and boss of the Bitcoin-oriented company Jan3 that intends to help nation-states with Bitcoin adoption, has published a Twitter/X post in which he stressed the role of Bitcoin in the success of such major companies as MicroStrategy and Tether.\nAt the same time, he took a dig at the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum.\n\nMow explains MicroStrategy’s and Tether’s success strategy\nMicroStrategy has been adding large BTC chunks to its balance sheet regularly since August of 2020, and Tether holds Bitcoin among the assets that back the USDT supply issued by it. Michael Saylor’s business intelligence giant now holds an astonishing $8.7 billion worth of Bitcoin, and this, surprisingly, exceeds the company’s market capitalization by $1 billion.\nEarlier this week, by the way, Michael Saylor called on the cryptocurrency community not to sell their Bitcoin, despite the continuous BTC price plunge that is taking place despite spot ETF approval by the SEC regulatory agency.\nAs for Tether, last quarter, it acquired another Bitcoin stash amounting to $380 million worth of Bitcoin. At the time of this writing, Tether holds 66,465 BTC.\nMow stressed the importance of the global flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin as opposed to the second largest one by market capitalization value – Ethereum.\ncard\n\nMow slams Ethereum, praises Bitcoin\nMow has recently been tweeting about his expectations for Bitcoin to reach $1 million. Elaborating on that forecast in one of his tweets, the Bitcoiner explained that this prediction should not be expected to be fulfilled instantly, like after the spot Bitcoin ETF was greenlit. What he meant was that the overall market fundamentals for Bitcoin have changed compared to how they stood before.\nIn a tweet published earlier today, Mow stated that the Bitcoin price does not depend on the ETF approval, and it rises of its own accord and at its own pace.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

Michael van de Poppe, has issued a social media post, suggesting that the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds may propelling the Bitcoin price much higher than everybody expects.\nHe also shared key reasons why Ethereum is likely to reach new momentum within the upcoming few weeks.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF impact on BTC, per Poppe\nHowever, as for the long term, he reckons that then a tremendous amount of new cash flows will start going into the Bitcoin market from fresh participants. When this happens, he adds, Bitcoin may soar much higher in the current cycle than everybody thinks it will.\nFamous crypto YouTuber Lark Davis seems to agree with van de Poppe. In a recent tweet, the cryptocurrency blogger called on his followers not to be afraid of the Bitcoin plunge taking place at the moment. He assumed that should anyone “look behind the scene, ” it would become clear that the top market players are taking advantage of this Bitcoin price dip – major financial institutions, nation-states and companies are taking this chance to accumulate Bitcoin cheaper than before.\nLark ended his tweet, stating: “This is the dip that you wanted 3 weeks ago.”\n\n3 key reasons for future Ethereum momentum, per Michael van de Poppe\nThe first reason is that Bitcoin is now bottoming out, and this is usually a big trigger for altcoins to start on a new bull run. The second one is the hype about spot Ethereum ETFs soon getting stronger. And the final reason is that Ethereum is soon to roll out new upgrades, which are expected to bring down transactional costs on this blockchain by a whopping 90%.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

continues aiming at altcoins. The most recent ones that he has been attacking on Twitter have been Solana (SOL) and Ripple-affiliated XRP tokens.\nEarlier today, Keiser took to X/Twitter to make another mega-bearish prediction on the future of the SOL price as he sees it.\n\nKeiser’s radical Solana prediction\nSince Jan. 11, Solana’s native token SOL has plunged by a staggering 26%, falling from the $107 peak (reached on the back of Bitcoin briefly soaring after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs) and hitting a $79.34 low on Jan. 23.\nIt was this continuous recent price fall that Max Keiser commented on in his tweet, promising that SOL would eventually trade at virtual zero against the global leading cryptocurrency and digital gold. A similar tweet was recently published by Keiser about XRP.\nIn a recent development, over the past 24 hours, the token in question has managed to stage a significant recovery of more than 10%, getting back to trading at the $87.66 price tag.\nPreviously, Keiser made a similar bearish prediction about Solana at the start of the year, predicting that SOL would definitely go down to $20. Back then, the token experienced a quick 15% price fall to $96.\n\nKeiser picking at XRP lately\nKeiser believes that Bitcoin is the only decentralized cryptocurrency since it was created by one person (known to the cryptocurrency community as Satoshi Nakamoto), who chose to disappear from public view almost immediately after BTC was released. Unlike Bitcoin, altcoins have been created by teams of IT engineers, hence Keiser's belief they are nothing but “centralized garbage.” Keiser also supports the SEC in its lawsuit against Ripple.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

            "content": "U.Today - In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, U.S. Head of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Products Rachel Aguirre stated that she believes the launch and the first two weeks of IBIT (the ticker for its spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded fund) trading have been more than just satisfactory for the company.\nIn slightly less than two weeks since the product was approved by the Securities and Exchange regulator and began trading, IBIT has seen its trading volume soar to a whopping $3 billion.\nAfter the ETF was released, it attracted more than $1.6 billion in inflows, Aguirre added. “We are here to provide investors’ access [to Bitcoin] and that’s exactly what we are doing,” she said proudly.\n\nBitcoin sees big investor demand – Rachel Aguirre\nWhile avoiding a direct answer to the question about whether BlackRock has plans to launch a spot Ethereum ETF, she said that the company always tries to think ahead and see how they can be useful to customers, trying to foresee customer needs.\nAguirre believes that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is offering three USPs to do with Bitcoin – it makes Bitcoin a lot more accessible, eliminates all difficulties of holding Bitcoin directly (hot and cold wallets, remembering passwords and having to keep them secured) and also, she stated, iShares provides quality service to clients. Currently, BlackRock holds 16,361 BTC to back its recently launched spot Bitcoin ETF.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

Without letting go, bears have pulled the price of the coin down to $42,822.59, with 1.21% growth in the past 24 hours. According to top market analyst Ali Martinez, this price level might prove to be significant for traders looking at a longer-term opportunity to flip the coin.\nTaking to X, Martinez noted that the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has fallen below its 90-day average over the past 12 months. This signal, according to the analyst, presents a \"buy-the-dip\" opportunity.\nThe accompanying chart in the post showed that previous buy-the-dip moments are typically followed by a period of intense growth that leads to a lower high. The projection to buy the dip is an ambitious call, especially as investors are still dragging a price drawdown in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) through the transfer of their shares.\nThe market has been largely unstable, with Bitcoin liquidating bears on some occasions and reversing growth on other days. In all, the buy-the-dip moment might favor investors who are ready to ride the coin’s current volatility trends until it attains stability.\n\nBitcoin halving as major catalyst\nThe event, slated to be held sometime in April, might ultimately shrink the supply of the asset. According to Samson Mow, this supply shortage and the massive increment in demand from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity Investments will trigger a major upshoot in the price of Bitcoin in the near future.\nOther top market experts are also optimistic that the halving event will catalyze the Bitcoin price beyond its previous all-time high (ATH) soon.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

According to data from the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, a whale with the wallet address \"0xAA15\" withdrew a total of 5,762 ETH worth approximately $15.06 million from Binance earlier today. Overall, this whale has bought a total of 50,733 ETH $99.2 million at an average price of $1,955 since Sept. 19, 2023.\nPer the Lookonchain outlook, another whale, \"0x9314\" also spent 7.29 million USDT to buy 2,800 ETH today, joining the host of accumulations of the second-largest cryptocurrency about two hours ago. This particular whale has a more robust portfolio, having stacked up a total of 82,780 ETH worth approximately $150.3 million at an average price of $1,816 since Jan 1, 2023.\nThe intriguing switch to Ethereum by these whales complements the $8.2 billion in large transaction volumes according to data from IntoTheBlock. These large transactions, which involve ETH worth at least $100,000, have jumped by 65.99% in the past 24 hours.\nEthereum’s whales are notably helping to change the game as the digital currency strives to recoup its lost ground to price action.\n\nEthereum price in mix\nBitcoin\nThis approval is boosting sentiment that the spot Ethereum ETF might also be on the way. This has further pushed retail sentiment as well, with Ethereum now notably eyeing the $2,700 benchmark.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

            "content": "U.Today - Ethereum continues to assert its dominance, proving to investors and enthusiasts why it reigns supreme among altcoins. The recent price action of Ethereum paints a bullish narrative, with potential signals pointing toward an ongoing growth cycle that could redefine its market stature.\nEthereum's market movement has been extremely dominant following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, with the asset recently piercing through significant resistance levels. After a sustained period above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, ETH has shown formidable strength.\nCurrently, Ethereum's price hovers around $2,600, with the immediate resistance level now likely forming near the $2,700 mark, a point at which sellers previously stepped in. A decisive break above this level could open the gates for further escalation toward the $3,000 psychological barrier.\nETH/USD Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, local support can be identified at around the $2,500 level, where a confluence of the EMAs and historical price reactions provides a safety net against potential pullbacks. Should Ethereum retreat from its current levels, the $2,400 and $2,300 levels stand ready to act as secondary and tertiary support zones, where buying interest has coalesced in the past.\nThe backdrop to this vigorous market movement is the speculation regarding the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF. The recent green light for a Bitcoin spot ETF has amplified discussions around its Ethereum counterpart. Such approval would be a significant catalyst for Ethereum, potentially drawing in a new wave of institutional and retail investment.\nThe primary strength of a spot Ethereum ETF lies in its direct exposure to the actual asset, rather than the derivatives market that futures-based ETFs represent. This means that an ETF would purchase actual Ethereum, providing direct support to its price and reflecting true market sentiment more accurately. Moreover, it would offer investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of managing cryptocurrency wallets and keys, thereby simplifying entry onto the crypto market.\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF would not only validate the asset's maturity and market significance but also solidify its position as a mainstay in the portfolios of diverse investors. Given Ethereum's foundational role in the development of DeFi and NFTs, an ETF would be a testament to its integral place in the digital economy.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF here\nThe relative calmness in Bitcoin's price has provided a conducive backdrop for altcoins to shine. Ethereum (ETH) notably breached the $2,500 mark, and Solana (SOL) regained a $100 valuation, underscoring a night of triumph for alternative cryptocurrencies. This decoupling of Bitcoin's movement from altcoin performance is a phenomenon that has been increasingly observed, suggesting a maturing market where assets can thrive on individual merit and ecosystem developments.\nThe chart at hand paints a picture of consolidation for Bitcoin, with the price hovering around the $45,000 region. The lack of a significant corrective move post-ETF news has lent a supportive floor to the broader crypto market. Trading volumes, alongside price action, indicate a steady holding pattern, a sign that the market is digesting the recent developments without panic or overenthusiasm.\nDespite the current stability, the market should not discount the potential for an uptick in Bitcoin’s value. Historically, actual capital inflow following such regulatory milestones has been a precursor to upward movements in the cryptocurrency's price. If history is to serve as a reference, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may yet act as a delayed fuse, igniting a rally as new capital finds its way onto the market.\nInvestors are advised to maintain cautious optimism. While current market conditions have not triggered the volatility many feared, the introduction of ETFs is a substantial change to the investment landscape of Bitcoin. As traditional investors and institutions increasingly engage with Bitcoin through these new financial products, the potential for a significant impact on the cryptocurrency’s value trajectory is tangible.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

firm Santiment, major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are displaying an intriguing profitability trend.\nIn a new tweet, Santiment noted that Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Ledger all have more than 80% of existing supplies in profit. This trend was last observed in March 2022. Bitcoin, ETH and XRP are presently marking 83%, 84% and 81% of their supplies in profit.\nThe \"Total Supply in Profit\" metric is an excellent way to determine how much the total supply on a network is up or down at any given time. This is a simple technique to determine whether a coin is worth more or less today than it was when it was initially minted, mined or entered circulation.\nMeanwhile, the percent of total supply in profit analyzes whether the percentage of supply available at any particular time, rather than the total number of coins on a network, is up or down at any given time. This represents a binary way of seeing the ratio of the total supply simply being in profit, even if it is a very small profit.\nThat said, Santiment states that BTC, XRP and ETH have their supplies at historically high-risk profit levels compared to their averages, which have been in the 55%-75% range since 2018.\nThe percentage of total supply in profit offers shorter-term perspectives on how the network is profiting or losing value on its investments over time.\nThis matters because crypto is a zero-sum game. When networks are heavily profiting, according to this metric, then it is imperative to watch out.\nThis does not rule out further upside moves for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to more exposure from ETFs and other positive news; however, there might be something else to watch out for.\nAccording to Santiment, a great signal to watch that would imply continued long-term growth would be a breach below 75% of their supplies in profit once again.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.\nThe mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.\nETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.\nIt is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.\nA technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

It could infuse the market with a renewed sense of optimism, potentially catalyzing a bullish trend for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nThe reduction in the RRR is a clear signal from the central bank aimed at stimulating economic activity by freeing up liquidity within the banking sector. This liquidity, in turn, can flow into various markets, crypto included, providing a much-needed boost during times of uncertainty. The increased liquidity often translates to greater investment in risk assets, as investors search for higher yields, which could lead to an uptick in Bitcoin's value.\nFurthermore, the anticipated issuance of more short-term debt by the U.S. Treasury, aligned with expectations, may further fortify this bullish scenario. The rationale is twofold: firstly, the U.S. elections loom on the horizon, and maintaining a buoyant market environment could be advantageous for the current administration.\nSecondly, with rate cuts on the Federal Reserve's agenda, it is financially prudent for the Treasury to delay long-term debt in favor of shorter maturities, positioning for lower interest rates in the future.\nThese factors combined present a compelling case for a positive impact on Bitcoin or other digital assets. The expected increase in short-term debt issuance, designed to maintain liquidity, could result in more capital flowing into the crypto market as investors diversify their portfolios in search of higher returns amid a flush liquidity landscape.\nHowever, it is not just liquidity that is driving the narrative. The PBoC's RRR cut coincides with a significant stimulus package aimed at bolstering Chinese equities. As these markets rally, the risk appetite among investors grows, potentially spilling over into the crypto domain and uplifting Bitcoin's price as a result.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

The emergence of this event is notably poised to change the outlook of the entire market as it will force a slump in Bitcoin issuance rate, which might ultimately impact its price. Crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant has shed insight into the potential price target for the coin after the halving event.\nThe CryptoQuant analysis drew reference from the first three Bitcoin halving events, highlighting a common theme in terms of price action. The coin typically begins an uptrend a year before the halving event and continues on a bullish ride to hit a new high after the halving before entering a bearish phase.\nIn the first halving and second halving events, Bitcoin’s price soared from $2.48 and $269 a year before the event, soaring to a high of $1,131 and $2,518 about a year later. Similar trends surfaced in the third halving cycle of 2020 as the price moved from a low of $7,255 to a high of $56,615 a year after.\nAhead of this current halving cycle, Bitcoin’s price has been picking an uptrend since April of last year, and should history repeat itself, it would chart a more ambitious price that might see it surpass its all-time high (ATH) above $69,000.\n\nBitcoin ETF catalyst\nSince their emergence, spot Bitcoin ETF products have not helped price growth in general but rather have led to bouts of liquidations as funds flew out of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\nNonetheless, with Bitcoin halving, the ETF might serve as the needed piece to help trigger the next bull market cycle.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

He offers his analysis, stating that Bitcoin's recent surge above $42,200 provided liquidity for long positions with a neutral impulse.\nAt the moment, he says the Bitcoin price is moving to fill the liquidity gap above $42,000, indicating potential volatility and about $659 million in liquidations have occurred.\nBased on this, Negentropic offers his outlook that bullish momentum could trigger $1 billion in short position liquidations, potentially propelling the market upward. This scenario might trigger a \"short squeeze,\" which happens when the price of an asset sharply increases as a large number of short sellers are compelled to exit their positions.\nThis bullish outlook is consistent with a drop in selling pressure from investors taking profits in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\nGBTC outflows appear to be slowing in recent days, and China's central bank has announced a $140 billion injection into the financial system.\nThe Glassnode cofounder stated in an earlier tweet that the liquidity surge has begun as China attempts to prop up its markets with enormous liquidity. He believes this might be the catalyst that propels the cryptocurrency and equity markets into the first half of 2024.\n\nBitcoin might reach $50,000 in Q1, 2024\nMarkus Thielen of 10x Research forecasts that Bitcoin prices could reach $50,000 by the end of the first quarter.\n\"Bitcoin rallied just shy of the 42,800 short-term resistance level implied by the November to January trend channel. While the 43,000–44,000 area probably turns into a minor resistance area, we expect Bitcoin to pierce through and reclaim the 50,000+ level by the end of this quarter,\" Thielen wrote in a tweet on Monday.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

30 birthday today by releasing a thoughtful essay titled \"The End of My Childhood.\" The essay delves into the genesis of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, underscoring its initial purpose as a response to the vulnerabilities of traditional banking systems.\nIn his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.\nFirst, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.\nHighlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.\n\nIdeal reality by Vitalik Buterin\nSource: \"The end of my childhood\" by Vitalik ButerinIn addition to Ethereum's role as a financial platform, Buterin encourages the community to broaden its focus, positioning his brainchild as a competitive force against centralized tech companies.\nThe essay articulates a nuanced perspective on the roles of token holders, intellectuals, builders and pragmatic users within the crypto ecosystem, highlighting the need for collaboration and understanding between these groups.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

The highlight of January was undeniably the groundbreaking move by the world's largest hedge funds and financial institutions, ushering in the era of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\nThese developments set off a roller-coaster ride for Bitcoin, with its price oscillating between $48,969 and $38,555 in just 28 days. However, as January bids farewell, the main cryptocurrency has made a resilient rebound, closing the month with a modest gain of 0.7%, nearly retracing its steps to the starting point.\nBTC to USD by CoinMarketCapAs we step into February, all eyes are on the historical data of Bitcoin prices, and the patterns hint at an intriguing trend. According to CryptoRank statistics covering February from 2011 to 2023, Bitcoin has, on average, exhibited impressive 14.5% profitability, with the median value not far behind at 12.2%.\nBitcoin monthly returns by CryptoRankThe significance of this month is further underscored by the fact that the last time the Bitcoin price faced a negative February was in 2020, a memory etched into the minds of those entrenched in the crypto market during that tumultuous time. Prior to that, the cryptocurrency experienced a downturn in February 2014.\nAnalyzing Bitcoin's price history reveals a consistent pattern of heightened activity and, more often than not, substantial price movements in February. While acknowledging the ever-changing nature of the crypto market, the extensive track record of BTC as an exchange-traded asset for over a decade provides valuable insights and guidance.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

It sets a psychological benchmark for traders, acting as a reference point for gauging market sentiment and performance over the year.\nBTC/USD chart by TradingViewPullbacks to this level can be particularly important as they often serve to test the strength and resilience of the ongoing market trend. If the price bounces off this level, it can reinforce the notion that the market is bullish, potentially leading to increased buying pressure. Conversely, a breakdown below the yearly open can signal bearish sentiment, possibly leading to further declines.\nA comprehensive analysis of the Bitcoin chart indicates that the asset has experienced significant volatility, with prices swinging between bullish surges and bearish pullbacks. The moving averages are converging, which typically suggests a period of consolidation as the market decides on its next major move. The current price hovers around $42,507, with the yearly opening acting as a critical pivot point.\n\nGrowth scenario for Bitcoin\nWith sustained trading volumes and positive market sentiment, Bitcoin might target the psychological level of $50,000.

            "content": "U.Today - According to the Bitcoin analysis provided by a Glassnode analyst, we have seen a notable surge that took the price to $42,000, a move that provided significant liquidity for long positions. This move is considered neutral and not driven by strong bullish or bearish impulses.\nThe liquidity gap that exists around the $42,000 mark is now being targeted by the market. This gap acts as a magnet for price, attracting it to fill the void, a phenomenon often accompanied by increased volatility. The recent price action aligns with this theory as Bitcoin endeavors to bridge this gap. In the process, approximately $659 million in liquidations have transpired, signaling a highly active market environment.\nBTC/USD Chart by TradingViewFrom a technical standpoint, the chart demonstrates that Bitcoin is currently testing the resistance level at $42,300. If it will decisively break through this level, the next significant resistance is likely to be found near the $43,300 region, which corresponds with the recent peak. On the downside, a support level can be identified around $39,900, which aligns with recent lows and provides a psychological level of support.\nIf the bullish momentum continues, and especially if reinforced by favorable market news or sentiment, it could catalyze a cascade of short position liquidations. It is estimated that such a scenario could trigger around $1 billion in short liquidations, providing a substantial upward thrust to the market.\nIf Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory and breaches the $43.3K resistance, we might see a significant bullish phase with targets potentially extending toward the $47,000 region and, if possible, to $50,000, where the next level of resistance would likely be encountered. Obviously, if the digital gold fails to maintain the current pace, we could see it retesting its support at $39,000.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

Wright revisited a series of posts by Buterin in 2017, where he discussed the early versions of the Ethereum protocol.\nBack then, Buterin had responded to a question about the possibility of building Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, expressing concerns about potential conflicts with Bitcoin's development team. He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.\nFast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol. Wright mused about the hypothetical scenario of having everything built on Bitcoin, envisioning a more streamlined and less fragmented system.\n\nBitcoin v.

In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's \"agreement.\"\nIf validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as \"equivocating\" validators.\nWhat makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.\nFor the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is \"pretty scary,\" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.\nCentralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues.

The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.\nBlockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.\nSubsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.\n\nEthereum price struggles\nCoinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million.

            "content": "U.Today - A staking client is software that interacts with the network to validate transactions and propose new blocks. When staking cryptocurrency, users' funds are effectively locked in a smart contract and used to perform these network functions in return for rewards. The architecture of these clients is crucial for security and network stability.\nSingle-client setups, mentioned in the post criticizing Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN)'s staking methods, can be more vulnerable to network-wide outages or consensus bugs. If most network participants are using the same client and a bug is discovered in that client, it could lead to a large portion of the network going offline or agreeing to incorrect state transitions.\nThis happened in November 2020 with Ethereum's Geth client, where a bug led to a chain split. A multi-client approach, where the network is supported by different software clients, is considered a best practice as it helps to prevent any single point of failure.\n\nImportance of multi-client staking environments\n\nConsensus bugs: If a consensus bug appears in the single client, it could lead to a significant portion of the network failing or splitting into different forks, as all nodes would be affected simultaneously.Centralization risk: A single-client setup can lead to centralization, where the development and maintenance of the network are dependent on a single team or company.Security weaknesses: Homogeneity in clients can lead to uniform security vulnerabilities that could be exploited network-wide.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

This is a necessary prerequisite for the launch of the EVM sidechain, and validators have currently cast 7 of the 28 votes required.\nRegarding the work done thus far, Peersyst stated that the sidechain is more advanced than ever before; after the audit with Bishop Fox, a second one has been carried out, whose details will be published soon.\nThe latest upgrades are being deployed, and the Cosmos SDK has gotten a blockchain update. Validators will soon be able to vote on the upgrade, which will incorporate Cosmos version 0.47 and Ethereum's EIP3855.\nIn addition, a new version of the bridge is on its way, allowing users to automatically and dynamically bridge any existing token on the EVM sidechain to the XRP Ledger. This would enable the EVM sidechain to serve as a gateway and connection to the rest of the EVMs, facilitating transactions and the use of all XRP Ledger Mainnet functionalities for all of these assets.\nA new UI has also been implemented to improve usability and allow for dynamic bridging between any sidechain, wallet and token. Meanwhile, a bridge SDK has been implemented to help developers create applications that leverage the bridge to access both networks.\nAlso, the latest version of the Blockscout Explorer is being developed. In addition to an improved UX/UI and other additional functions for verifying and executing smart contracts, the explorer would also provide a new dynamic display of dApps.\nEarlier in January, XRP Ledger developers announced the release of rippled 2.0, which includes two major feature enhancements: XLS-38 Cross-Chain Bridge and XLS-40 Decentralized Identity.\nThe Cross-Chain Bridge would allow XRP and fungible tokens issued on the XRPL to move seamlessly between the XRPL Mainnet and XRPL sidechains, as well as between the XRPL Mainnet and the upcoming EVM sidechain.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

            "content": "U.Today - Fidelity's Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer has provided a critical perspective on Bitcoin's trajectory, analyzing it through the lens of network growth and scarcity features.\nTimmer points to the foundational principle that Bitcoin's value is closely correlated with the expansion of its network — a concept reflected in Metcalfe's Law, which posits that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users.\nThe adoption curve for Bitcoin supports this theory, showcasing a consistent power-law distribution over time. This suggests not just growth, but a predictable, sustained increase that closely mirrors the S-curve typical of new technology adoption.\nThe chart shared by Timmer illustrates this progression, plotting the number of nonzero Bitcoin addresses over time and overlaying a standard power regression curve. The fit is compelling, suggesting that despite volatility, Bitcoin's adoption is not merely sporadic but follows a path anticipated by the models that have charted the course of successful technologies in the past.\nScarcity is another cornerstone of Timmer's thesis. Bitcoin's stock-to-flow model, which correlates price with the scarcity of supply, suggests that as Bitcoin becomes harder to mine and the rate of new supply slows, the price could rise if demand remains steady or increases.\nThis interplay of scarcity and demand is a dance that shapes Bitcoin's price movements in the face of changing economic policies, such as those set by the Federal Reserve.\nWhile the price chart provided reflects recent bearish trends, Timmer's insights suggest a broader view. Volatility in the price of Bitcoin is not just noise; it is part of a larger pattern of growth and acceptance. Timmer's articulation of its growth scenario offers a reasoned perspective for long-term observers and participants in the cryptocurrency market.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce the achievement. This milestone is particularly noteworthy as it underscores the increasing adoption and utilization of Bitcoin, with more users actively engaging with the cryptocurrency.\nThe surge in active addresses can be interpreted as a positive indicator of the overall health and strength of the Bitcoin network. It suggests a broader user base and heightened interest in the leading cryptocurrency, reinforcing its position as a prominent player in the digital asset space.\nThe rise in active BTC addresses could be attributed to various factors, including a growing awareness of Bitcoin, increased institutional participation and a general trend toward cryptocurrency adoption globally. As more individuals and institutions embrace Bitcoin, the network's user base expands, leading to a surge in active addresses.\n\nBitcoin price impact\nHowever, it is essential to note that while a surge in active addresses is a positive sign for the overall health of the Bitcoin network, it does not guarantee an immediate or direct correlation with price movements. Market dynamics are influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments and global sentiment toward cryptocurrencies.\nAs of the latest market update, the current price of Bitcoin stands at $40,128. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a modest increase of 0.25%, showing resilience in the face of recent market fluctuations. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency has seen a 5.40% decrease in the last 30 days, reflecting the inherent volatility of the digital asset market.\nThe trading volume, a crucial metric reflecting market activity, is down 5.00% in the last 24 hours, currently resting at $18,683,037,742. This decrease in trading volume suggests potential stabilization in the market, as participants may be adopting a more cautious approach amid recent price fluctuations.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"

launch of U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking bitcoin deepens ties between the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and the traditional financial system, potentially creating unforeseen new risks, some experts say.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this month approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs from issuers including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Invesco/Galaxy Digital, in a watershed moment for a crypto industry dogged by bankruptcies and crime.\nThe SEC had long rejected the products citing investor protection concerns, but was forced to rethink its position after losing a court challenge brought by Grayscale Investments.\nCrypto enthusiasts say the products will allow investors to more easily and safely gain exposure to bitcoin. But when approving the products, SEC Chair Gary Gensler warned bitcoin remains a \"volatile asset\" and that investors should be wary.\nThe ETFs combined have around $21 billion in assets, and could draw as much as $100 billion this year alone from retail and institutional investors, some analysts predict. Bitcoin is down more than 6% since the products were launched.\nIf widely adopted, the products could pose risks to other parts of the financial system during times of market stress by exacerbating bitcoin price volatility, or creating dislocations between the price of the ETF and bitcoin, said some ETF experts, citing evidence from previous ETF volatility events.\nOthers said last year's U.S. banking upheaval showed that financial and crypto markets can transmit risks to one another. Crypto lender Silvergate Bank, for example, liquidated following withdrawals sparked by the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which in turn stoked panic that contributed to the failure of  Signature Bank  (OTC:SBNY), regulators have said. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, meanwhile, sparked a run on stablecoin USD Coin.\n\"As investors pour money into these products, you substantially increase the risk of much greater interconnection between the core of the financial system and the crypto ecosystem,\" said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, an advocacy group which had urged the SEC to reject bitcoin ETFs, citing risks to investors and the financial system.\nConceived in 2009 as an alternative payment mechanism, bitcoin is mostly used as a speculative investment. Its daily average volatility is roughly three and a half times that of equities, according to the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\nBitcoin ETFs could \"particularly exacerbate\" that volatility in times of market stress, and other channels through which ETFs can create systemic risks, said Antonio Sánchez Serrano, principal economist at the European Systemic Risk Board, the European Union's financial risk watchdog.\nThose other channels include the decoupling of the ETF price from the underlying asset, which can cause stress for institutions heavily exposed to the products or which rely on them for liquidity management.\n\"The differences with a plain-vanilla stock ETF are simply too large in terms of embedded risks,\" Serrano wrote in an email to Reuters, referring to bitcoin ETFs, which he classified as complex.\nExchange-traded products that are complex, less liquid and highly leveraged have experienced stress in the past.\nIn February 2018, a volatility-tracking exchange-traded note went bust amid a surge in volatility, causing investors $2 billion in losses.\nIn 2020, COVID-19 shutdowns sparked a sell off in some corporate bond ETFs. That stress would have spread to the broader fixed income market had the Federal Reserve not provided emergency support, including buying shares of bond ETFs, the CFA Institute, an investment professional organization which has also studied ETF risks, has argued.\nThe ETF industry generally disputes that its products pose systemic risks.\nIn their risk disclosures, bitcoin ETF issuers list a slew of market, policy, and operational risks, but acknowledge the immaturity of bitcoin means some hazards may be unforeseeable.\nThe SEC did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"TOMORROW'S FAILURE\"\nTo be sure, the risks will largely depend on how widely adopted the ETFs ultimately become, said Serrano and other experts.\n\"Systemic risk is all about size... We do not yet know enough about who is actually purchasing these and in what proportions,\" Olivier Fines, head of advocacy and policy research, EMEA, at the CFA Institute said in an email.\nCrypto industry executives also point out that crypto crises, most notably when cryptocurrencies lost around two-thirds of their $3 trillion value in 2022, have mostly been contained to the crypto sector.\nConnectivity between cryptocurrencies and the financial system still remains \"very limited,\" said Lapo Guadagnuolo, senior analyst at S&P Global Ratings.\nETF issuers also say they have created guardrails. For example, the products will be redeemed in cash, rather than bitcoin, minimizing the number of intermediaries that physically hold the cryptocurrency.\n\"I don't see cataclysmic... dynamics in any of these products,\" said Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, which partnered with Invesco on its ETF.\nStill, at least one top SEC official has flagged concerns.\nWhen voting against approving the ETFs in January, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said in a statement that the agency had not considered whether the ETFs would create a nexus with traditional markets that \"allows crises in largely non-compliant crypto markets to spill over.\"\n\nCrenshaw, who did not respond to a request for comment, also said she was worried the ETFs could pave the way for riskier products.\n\"I fear that today we are setting ourselves up for tomorrow's failure,\" she added.\n"

            "time": "Published Jan 31, 2024 09:57AM ET",
            "content": "U.Today - The U.K. Supreme Court recently denied Craig Wright permission to appeal a ruling in his libel case against Peter McCormack, where he was awarded a nominal 1 GBP in compensation. Wright had claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, but the panel of judges dismissed his assertions.\nSubsequently, Wright pursued a different legal avenue, asserting ownership of intellectual property related to Bitcoin and filing lawsuits against developers maintaining the open-source code. Despite initial success in court, Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey's intervention in October 2023 led to the rejection of Wright's intellectual property claims. Instead, the court allowed developers to proceed with allegations that Wright submitted forged documents to support his fabrications.\nFortune's recent report reveals that Wright is now offering a settlement to the Crypto Open Patent Alliance, representing the defendant's developers. Legal analysts speculate that this unexpected move indicates Wright's growing apprehension regarding the forgery allegations and the serious consequences of presenting false evidence in court.\nProminent Bitcoin evangelist Samson Mow commented on the development, stating, \"Faketoshi rekt.\" The term \"Faketoshi\" is colloquially used to refer to Wright due to his claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto, and \"rekt\" implies a setback or defeat.\nAs the developers decline Wright's settlement offer, the stage is set for a court inquiry into the forgery allegations. The crypto community watches closely as one of its most controversial figures faces the prospect of legal scrutiny for alleged dishonesty and bullying tactics.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today\n"
