            "time": "Published Jan 29, 2024 09:27AM ET",
            "content": "U.Today - A Reddit user from the Bitcoin subreddit has claimed a nearly miraculous stunt — guessing two Bitcoin seed phrases in under five minutes, accessing corresponding wallets that were, as expected, empty. While the post might shock some unseasoned Bitcoin users, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of how seed phrases work.\nSeed phrases, the linchpin of wallet security, are generated in accordance with BIP39. They consist of 12 to 24 words, drawn from a specific list of 2048 words. The final word in a seed phrase is a checksum, which serves as a fail-safe against incorrect word entry.\nIf even a single word is out of place, or the sequence is jumbled, the checksum will not match, and the wallet software will typically reject the phrase. This makes the task of \"guessing\" a seed phrase practically impossible without using unrealistically high computing power.\nThe author of the post likely did not guess existing seed phrases but rather created new wallet addresses. Since there are innumerable potential combinations for seed phrases, it is statistically certain that many lead to unclaimed wallets. Hence, the author's claim, while technically true, is misleading. They did not crack or access someone else's wallet; they inadvertently generated new, unused wallets.\nThe BIP39 standard ensures that the probability of randomly generating an active wallet's seed phrase, especially one containing funds, is microscopic.\nAs for the most recent Bitcoin price performance; it shows that BTC has been experiencing consolidation with a slight downtrend visible. The current trading price is around the $42,513 mark, with the moving averages acting as dynamic levels of support and resistance.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?",
            "time": "Published Jan 29, 2024 08:28AM ET",
            "content": "U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.\nThe distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.\nSuch a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.\nConversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.\nThe substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "content": "U.Today - BitMEX cofounder and former CEO Arthur Hayes has shared a major Bitcoin (BTC) price forecast that puts an end to speculation surrounding when the coin will test its bottom.\n\nDrawing on this, he forecasts a 30% correction from the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) high of $48,000. If this projection comes to pass, then he foresees Bitcoin dropping to the $30,000 and $35,000 price range.\nBitcoin has been in a freefall since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted the 11 spot BTC ETFs that now trade in the market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has dropped by a milder 0.64% in the past 24 hours to $40,042.44. This is an impressive figure that shows recovery, seeing as the coin fell as low as $39,105.51 in the past 24 hours.\nKnown for his big bold predictions, Arthur Hayes believes there might be some forms of relief introduced by the Federal Reserve to support growth; nonetheless, he is convinced crypto is primed to play a key role as a hedge against inflation as mainstream banks are on the verge of collapsing.\n\nHayes is a big promoter of the Solana ecosystem, and the sell-off showcases that more of a downward spiral might still be underway for this asset that has lost 12.3% of its value in the past week amid an intense sell-off.\nHayes, however, noted that should Bitcoin fall below $35,000, he will begin to load up on Dogwifhat (WIF), attesting to the potential of the meme coin to outperform when the market finally enters the recovery phase.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "content": "U.Today - The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is far from the release of the market bears as the top digital currency dropped below the psychologically important level of $40,000. At the time of writing, the coin is priced at $39,968.21, despite being up by 0.95% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has notably been flirting with the $40,000 level, with volatility that has cast doubt on what’s next for the top coin.\nWith all eyes on Bitcoin, the latest correction might be a result of the Jim Cramer effect. Based on precedent, crypto proponents on X have identified a pattern that sees Bitcoin move in the opposite direction from what Jim Cramer identifies. As the CNBC Mad Money Host noted on X on Jan. 24, he pointed out that Bitcoin was off to a strong start in defiance of his earlier call that the coin’s floor might still be far away.\nWhen this statement was made, Bitcoin was trading at about the $40,000 price mark, and its correction at the time of writing suggests the Jim Cramer theory might be accurate after all.\n\nThe launched spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) product has not produced enough impact, as projected by top market veterans like Samson Mow. While there is enough time to hit the $1 million price projection from Mow, Bitcoin’s outlook since the product started trading has been relatively gloomy.\nWith the Bitcoin halving event now ahead, the market is choosing to lean on another network fundamental to anticipate a massive bullish resurgence in the price of the digital currency. According to top analysts like Benjamin Cowen, BTC is poised to enter the bull market ahead of the forthcoming halving.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

Beyond this, he noted that the network hashrate is also worth watching. With this metric cruising to a new high in recent times, higher growth is expected ahead of the next halving event.\nNext on his list is the Finex whale accumulation metric and the 200 WMA trend. Surprisingly, he listed the Tether (USDT) Asset Under Management (AUM) as an essential indicator to watch as the stablecoin forms the key liquidity base for the coin.\nBesides these on-chain indicators, Samson Mow also named the government’s interest payments on debt, the Debt GDP ratios, nation state Bitcoin adoption, real inflation and M3 Money. All of these indicators have a convergence point to influence the BTC price outlook in the long term.\n\nAt the current price level, Bitcoin is now down 38.9% from its all-time high (ATH) of $68,789.63. To proponents like Samson Mow, the forthcoming halving event will complement the spot BTC ETF products to help revive the price of Bitcoin in the most dramatic way ever.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "content": "U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.\nThe Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nA cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.\nBTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive \"war\" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.\nThe upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "content": "U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.\nThe breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.\nSHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.\nFor a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.\nThe first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.\n\nThe significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.\nSuch a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.\nThe immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.\nThe 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.\nMarket participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "time": "Published Jan 29, 2024 03:27AM ET",
            "content": "U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\nThe 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.\nXRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.\n\nThe ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.\nAnalyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.\nIf Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.\n\nThe technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.\nDespite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.\nLooking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.\nConversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

This pivotal line, sitting approximately at $0.55, is now the battleground where XRP's short-term destiny is being contested.\nIn recent days, XRP's price action has been characterized by its struggle to overcome a series of local resistance levels. A notable rejection was faced around the $0.63 mark, which has added to the narrative of an asset under pressure. Despite these rejections, the asset's ability to stay afloat above the 200-day EMA suggests underlying strength and potential for growth.\nXRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe market's oppressiveness toward XRP can be attributed to various factors, including lack of usecase for XRP and a poor performance throughout the 2023. However, the past has shown that XRP can swiftly shift from oppressed states to strong bullish rallies, often catching many off-guard.\nFor a scenario where XRP's growth continues, it is essential for the token to maintain its stand above the 200-day EMA. If this level holds, it can serve as a springboard for future bullish attempts. A decisive close above this moving average could stimulate investor confidence, potentially leading to a challenge of the recent resistance at $0.63. A break and hold above this level could signal a trend reversal and may pave the way for XRP to target higher resistances, possibly around the $0.70 to $0.75 regions.\n\nAfter dipping to a support level around $88 on December 20, 2023, Solana has rebounded, forming a higher low near the $90 mark. This movement suggests accumulating strength and a possible change in direction from the previous downward trend. The local trendline resistance, which Solana is currently testing, is evident at approximately $97.50.\nTwo pivotal price levels stand out on Solana's chart. The first resistance level after the trendline sits near the $100 psychological mark. This round number has historically been a challenging point for Solana to breach decisively. Beyond that, the $104 level looms as the next significant barrier, which was a previous local high around January 3, 2024.\nConversely, on the support side, the level to watch is around $88, as mentioned earlier. This price has proven to be a firm foundation, with buyers stepping in to uphold Solana's valuation. A secondary support level is present near $85, just below the 50-day moving average, acting as a safety net for any potential retracements.\n\nThe rapid growth witnessed in the past few days has been nothing short of impressive. Ethereum, which lingered around the $2,400 mark in the early days of February, has seen a significant influx of buying pressure, leading to a breakthrough past key resistance levels. This positive price action posits two potential scenarios for the smart contract giant.\nIn one scenario, Ethereum could continue its aggressive push, riding the wave of current market optimism towards the $3,000 target. If this momentum is maintained, and with the additional fuel from the recent high volume of trades, ETH could test $3,000 in the coming days. A consolidation above $2,600 would be crucial for this scenario to unfold, as it would establish a new support level, reinforcing investor confidence.\nAlternatively, given the volatile nature of the crypto markets, a retracement could occur before Ethereum reaches $3,000. This would likely see the asset retesting support at the $2,500 level, which if held, could serve as a springboard for a second wave towards and beyond $3,000.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.\nThe steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.\nETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.\nConversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.\n\nThe chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.\nA sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.\nAs for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.\nThe moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.\n\nAnalyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.\nOn the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.\nThe price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.\nThis potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.\nETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum’s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.\nAdditional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum’s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.\nThe current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.\n\nAs Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.\nOn the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.\n\nThe current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.\nHowever, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.\nIn terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "content": "U.Today - Shiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.\nAn ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.\nSHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.\nIn contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.\n\nA closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.\nThis corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.\n\nHowever, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.\nThe recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.\nYet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "title": "XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?",
            "time": "Published Jan 29, 2024 12:28AM ET",
            "content": "U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.\nAs of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.\nXRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.\nFurther complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.\n\nAt the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.\nResistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.\nThe relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.\n\nAt present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.\nResistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.\nThe selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.\nOn the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary \"fuel,\" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "time": "Published Jan 28, 2024 07:57PM ET",
            "content": "U.Today - Billy Markus, who founded the iconic meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin together with Jackson Palmer back in 2013 and launched it, has taken to Twitter/X social media network to comment on the further plunge Bitcoin took earlier today as it went below the $39,000 level.\n“Shibetoshi Nakamoto”, as Markus is known on Twitter, stated in his recent tweet “Good morning to everyone except Bitcoin,” thus showing sarcastically his dissatisfaction with the volatility of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, the one which he and Palmer parodied when they created DOGE.\nEarlier today, the leading digital currency dived under $39,000, hitting $38,543. However, it quickly rebounded, adding 2.41% (versus the previous loss of 3.52%) and at the time of this writing, BTC is exchanging hands at $39,471.\n\nHowever, that did not last long and Bitcoin started its rapid descent into the red. By now, it has lost a whopping 19.56%, falling from $49,000 to the current $39,471 price mark.\nAs reported, earlier today the cryptocurrency market was struck by a massive bloodbath as $100 million in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were liquidated across various crypto trading venues.\nAside from that, according to a recent tweet of cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez, over the period of the last two weeks, Bitcoin miners have dumped a large chunk of Bitcoin, getting rid of 70,000 BTC (the equivalent of $3 billion in fiat).\n\nStill, while a great many cryptocurrency traders hope that Bitcoin will drop into the $30,000 range, so they can start buying the dip, vocal Bitcoin maximalist and evangelist, CEO of Jan3, Samson Mow, does not believe it is likely to happen.\nIn the meantime, Mow remains a strong believer that Bitcoin will eventually reach the much-expected $1 million mark. However, he does not specify when it is likely to happen.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"
