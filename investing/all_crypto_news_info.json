            "content": "U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.\n\nAs such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:\nEthereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.\nStaked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether \"stake\" is being held with a significant 25% profit.\nThe aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).\nOut of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.\nAptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "content": "U.Today - Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and critic of altcoins, has once again attacked XRP.\nIn a recent X post he captioned \"XRP Crash Update,\" Keiser calls XRP \"a centralized garbage that is mathematically guaranteed to trade at virtual zero against Bitcoin.\"\nKeiser posted a screenshot of the XRP chart showing its price decline. At the time of writing, XRP was down 5.68% in the last 24 hours to $0.498. Bitcoin fell 5.25% in the same time frame, trading at $38,750, mirroring the market's poor performance.\nBitcoin (BTC) fell below $39,000 in Tuesday's market crash, wiping out virtually all of the previous two months' gains ahead of spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals in the United States.\nXRP began to surge against Bitcoin on Jan. 9 after hitting a bottom that marked multiyear lows in its pairing. This trend sustained for a while until XRP began mirroring the BTC price trend, subsequently entering into range-trading in its BTC pairing.\n\nHowever, Keiser's predictions have not always been correct, as Ripple won a significant victory in the SEC litigation after the judge ruled that XRP was not a security. The SEC also dropped its accusations against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen.\nXRP has also demonstrated resilience, maintaining its position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization despite legal woes and market uncertainty. XRP is now the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at more than $27 billion.\nThat said, whether XRP will crash to virtual zero in its Bitcoin pairing or rise to new heights remains yet to be seen.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

The Glassnode cofounder added reassuringly that the \"bigger picture still remains very bullish\" for the Bitcoin price.\nThe digital asset markets observed an upswing in speculation leading up to the Bitcoin ETF approvals, with a general sell-the-news event playing out over the following days.\nBitcoin has fallen over 20% from an intraday high of $49,021 when the ETFs went live, as excitement over the products gave way to anxiety about the eventual extent of demand for them.\n\nThe latest sell-off marks the fourth time in the last year or so that Bitcoin has lost approximately 20%.\nElliott's wave theory claims that markets are prone to repeating wave patterns. Applying the approach to Bitcoin implies that the largest cryptocurrency will find a base between $36,000 and $38,000 before a fifth wave reignites last year's ascent.\nAccording to cryptocurrency analyst Ali, historical patterns demonstrate that in bull markets, BTC price declines are consistently followed by further upside increases.

Michael Saylor’s business intelligence giant now holds an astonishing $8.7 billion worth of Bitcoin, and this, surprisingly, exceeds the company’s market capitalization by $1 billion.\nEarlier this week, by the way, Michael Saylor called on the cryptocurrency community not to sell their Bitcoin, despite the continuous BTC price plunge that is taking place despite spot ETF approval by the SEC regulatory agency.\nAs for Tether, last quarter, it acquired another Bitcoin stash amounting to $380 million worth of Bitcoin. At the time of this writing, Tether holds 66,465 BTC.\nMow stressed the importance of the global flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin as opposed to the second largest one by market capitalization value – Ethereum.\ncard\n\nMow has recently been tweeting about his expectations for Bitcoin to reach $1 million. Elaborating on that forecast in one of his tweets, the Bitcoiner explained that this prediction should not be expected to be fulfilled instantly, like after the spot Bitcoin ETF was greenlit. What he meant was that the overall market fundamentals for Bitcoin have changed compared to how they stood before.\nIn a tweet published earlier today, Mow stated that the Bitcoin price does not depend on the ETF approval, and it rises of its own accord and at its own pace.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

This sell-off is significant enough to dampen the bullish momentum that has persisted on the market recently.\nGrayscale's move came in the wake of the Bitcoin ETF's approval, which marked a watershed moment for cryptocurrency's mainstream financial integration. Alongside Grayscale, other major players like iShares by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity and Bitwise hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin, collectively amounting to billions of dollars in value.\nBTC/USD Chart by TradingViewThe disposal of such a substantial sum by Grayscale could understandably cause a temporary setback in market sentiment. The market's reaction to this divestment has been swift, with Bitcoin prices reflecting the impact of the reduced holdings. However, it is essential to consider the broader market context.\nBitcoin's price analysis indicates a dip, but it is crucial to note that the fundamental drivers of the bull market remain intact. The adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, with institutional interest still high and new developments in blockchain technology emerging regularly. These factors suggest that the bullish trend may resume once the immediate impact of Grayscale's sell-off dissipates.\nMoreover, the cryptocurrency market has shown resilience in the face of similar challenges in the past. Bitcoin, in particular, has a history of bouncing back from corrections, bolstered by its limited supply and increasing demand, especially from institutional investors seeking alternative assets amid economic crises.\nLooking ahead, the market is likely poised for recovery, with the temporary bearish pressure likely to ease as the ecosystem adjusts to Grayscale's realignment.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

This upcoming update is called the Prague upgrade, also referred to as the Pectra upgrade, and has been a hot topic in the Ethereum community.\nTestnets are essential staging grounds for new features, and the Dencun upgrade will first roll out across several testnets: Goerli on Jan. 17, Sepolia on Jan. 30 and Holesky on Feb. 7, 2024. These testnets will allow developers to fine-tune the upgrade in a controlled environment, ensuring everything operates smoothly before going live on the main network.\nSource: Tim Beiko on Ethereum MagiciansThe core development team is currently in a debate over prioritizing the implementation of Verkle trees, a data structure that would optimize storage and access to information on Ethereum. While some developers advocate making Verkle trees the sole focus, others suggest pursuing a smaller feature fork alongside the Verkle development.\nThe main argument for concentrating solely on Verkle trees stems from their complexity and the time investment needed to implement them effectively. This could mean that if Verkle trees become the next priority, no new execution layer (EL) features might appear for 12 to 24 months, or possibly longer.\nNevertheless, there is an understanding that even if the focus shifts to Verkle trees, minor updates to the Ethereum Layer (EL) might still be necessary. For example, changes to the gas limit for data availability are crucial for Ethereum's scaling solutions and require coordination across both the execution layer and the consensus layer (CL).\nThe Prague upgrade is set to include various proposals that aim to refine the Ethereum platform on different layers, including precompiles for specific cryptographic operations, a new EVM object format (EOF) and modifications to smart contract capabilities.\nThe Prague upgrade promises to be a significant event that will shape the future of the Ethereum ecosystem.

            "time": "- Jan 28, 2024",
            "content": "U.Today - Shiba Inu is currently showcasing a price pattern that could potentially lead to a reversal. The pattern, characterized by SHIB breaking below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average, might be indicating an opportune moment for investors and traders to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into their positions.\nThe 200-day EMA is a critical long-term indicator that many investors watch to determine market trends. A break below this line can often suggest bearish sentiment. However, for the astute investor, this can also present an attractive entry point, especially for those looking to DCA or accumulating during dips in anticipation of future gains.\nDespite the current breach, SHIB's approach to this level has historically been met with a strong reaction from buyers, sometimes resulting in a notable price reversal. If the pattern holds true to its historical behavior, the price of SHIB may soon find sufficient support to halt the decline and initiate an upward trajectory.\nNonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that SHIB has been facing consistent selling pressure, evident every time there is an attempt to push the price higher. This consistent sell-off following attempts to rise has created a challenging environment for SHIB to sustain any substantial gains.\nThe current market scenario for SHIB is a delicate balancing act between bearish pressure and the potential for a bullish reversal. For new investors looking to enter the market, the area just below the 200 EMA could prove to be a significant level, provided they are comfortable with the inherent risks involved with such volatile assets. Older investors can use the price level to dollar cost average their holdings.\n\nThe chart reveals that Solana has decisively exited its previous uptrend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, and has entered a correction phase. The volume profile during this downturn suggests that the selling pressure has intensified, leading to a breakdown below critical support levels. This pattern is often a precursor to further declines as market confidence wanes.\nFor those looking for a scenario in which Solana could rebound, a relief rally could emerge from oversold conditions, indicated by RSI approaching lower bounds. Such a rally would require a catalyst, possibly in the form of positive developments within the Solana ecosystem or broader crypto market sentiment shifts. A rebound scenario might also be supported by traders looking for value buys at lower price points, thus creating sufficient buying pressure to counter the recent downtrend.\n\nThe 50-day EMA has historically been a stronghold for Ethereum's price, acting as a pivot point between the bullish and bearish territories. After a period of decline, Ethereum's approach to this level suggests that we may be on the cusp of a reversal. This is particularly compelling given Ethereum's past performance, where touches of the 50 EMA have often led to a resurgence in buying activity, driving the price upward.\nCurrently, the intersection with the 50 EMA aligns with a descending trading volume, indicating a potential decrease in selling pressure. This trend could signify market consolidation before a bullish reversal, as lower volume alongside support touchpoints often precedes a shift in momentum.\nThe implications of this volume decrease are twofold. First, it may suggest that the recent sell-off is losing steam, and the market is running out of sellers at current price levels. Second, it may imply that the market is awaiting further catalysts or developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as updates on Ethereum 2.0 or broader crypto market trends, before initiating the next significant move.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "content": "U.Today - In the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a critical juncture, with renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicting a potential bullish breakout. In a recent tweet, van de Poppe conveyed his insights, indicating that Ethereum was approaching the low of 2022 and was likely to absorb liquidity at that level.\nHe expressed the belief that in the event of a spot ETF approval for Bitcoin (BTC), there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. Following this, analyst van de Poppe foresaw a rotation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence.\nAccording to the most recent data, Ethereum is presently valued at $2,294, indicating a noteworthy 3.04% uptick in the past 24 hours. The trading volume within this period has experienced a substantial surge, escalating by 36.14% and peaking at $12.48 billion. In the aftermath of this modest rally, ETH has observed $21.60 million in short liquidations and $11.79 million in long liquidations, as reported by CoinGlass.\n\nMarket sentiment is building as BlackRock expresses confidence in the SEC's approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF, with expectations pointing toward a potential decision as early as this Wednesday. A positive outcome could trigger a ripple effect in the broader cryptocurrency market, impacting not only Bitcoin but also potentially leading to a rotation of funds into Ethereum.\nMichaël Van de Poppe's prediction hinges on the notion that Bitcoin spot ETF approval may prompt a notable uptrend for Ethereum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments, recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential spillover effects of major regulatory decisions. As Ethereum stands at this critical juncture, the market awaits further clarity from regulatory bodies and key players in the cryptocurrency space.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

According to data from the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, a whale with the wallet address \"0xAA15\" withdrew a total of 5,762 ETH worth approximately $15.06 million from Binance earlier today. Overall, this whale has bought a total of 50,733 ETH $99.2 million at an average price of $1,955 since Sept. 19, 2023.\nPer the Lookonchain outlook, another whale, \"0x9314\" also spent 7.29 million USDT to buy 2,800 ETH today, joining the host of accumulations of the second-largest cryptocurrency about two hours ago. This particular whale has a more robust portfolio, having stacked up a total of 82,780 ETH worth approximately $150.3 million at an average price of $1,816 since Jan 1, 2023.\nThe intriguing switch to Ethereum by these whales complements the $8.2 billion in large transaction volumes according to data from IntoTheBlock. These large transactions, which involve ETH worth at least $100,000, have jumped by 65.99% in the past 24 hours.\nEthereum’s whales are notably helping to change the game as the digital currency strives to recoup its lost ground to price action.\n\nThis approval is boosting sentiment that the spot Ethereum ETF might also be on the way.

            "content": "U.Today - Ethereum continues to assert its dominance, proving to investors and enthusiasts why it reigns supreme among altcoins. The recent price action of Ethereum paints a bullish narrative, with potential signals pointing toward an ongoing growth cycle that could redefine its market stature.\nEthereum's market movement has been extremely dominant following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, with the asset recently piercing through significant resistance levels. After a sustained period above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, ETH has shown formidable strength.\nCurrently, Ethereum's price hovers around $2,600, with the immediate resistance level now likely forming near the $2,700 mark, a point at which sellers previously stepped in. A decisive break above this level could open the gates for further escalation toward the $3,000 psychological barrier.\nETH/USD Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, local support can be identified at around the $2,500 level, where a confluence of the EMAs and historical price reactions provides a safety net against potential pullbacks. Should Ethereum retreat from its current levels, the $2,400 and $2,300 levels stand ready to act as secondary and tertiary support zones, where buying interest has coalesced in the past.\nThe backdrop to this vigorous market movement is the speculation regarding the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF. The recent green light for a Bitcoin spot ETF has amplified discussions around its Ethereum counterpart. Such approval would be a significant catalyst for Ethereum, potentially drawing in a new wave of institutional and retail investment.\nThe primary strength of a spot Ethereum ETF lies in its direct exposure to the actual asset, rather than the derivatives market that futures-based ETFs represent. This means that an ETF would purchase actual Ethereum, providing direct support to its price and reflecting true market sentiment more accurately. Moreover, it would offer investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of managing cryptocurrency wallets and keys, thereby simplifying entry onto the crypto market.\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF would not only validate the asset's maturity and market significance but also solidify its position as a mainstay in the portfolios of diverse investors. Given Ethereum's foundational role in the development of DeFi and NFTs, an ETF would be a testament to its integral place in the digital economy.\n\nThe relative calmness in Bitcoin's price has provided a conducive backdrop for altcoins to shine. Ethereum (ETH) notably breached the $2,500 mark, and Solana (SOL) regained a $100 valuation, underscoring a night of triumph for alternative cryptocurrencies. This decoupling of Bitcoin's movement from altcoin performance is a phenomenon that has been increasingly observed, suggesting a maturing market where assets can thrive on individual merit and ecosystem developments.\nThe chart at hand paints a picture of consolidation for Bitcoin, with the price hovering around the $45,000 region. The lack of a significant corrective move post-ETF news has lent a supportive floor to the broader crypto market. Trading volumes, alongside price action, indicate a steady holding pattern, a sign that the market is digesting the recent developments without panic or overenthusiasm.\nDespite the current stability, the market should not discount the potential for an uptick in Bitcoin’s value. Historically, actual capital inflow following such regulatory milestones has been a precursor to upward movements in the cryptocurrency's price. If history is to serve as a reference, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may yet act as a delayed fuse, igniting a rally as new capital finds its way onto the market.\nInvestors are advised to maintain cautious optimism. While current market conditions have not triggered the volatility many feared, the introduction of ETFs is a substantial change to the investment landscape of Bitcoin. As traditional investors and institutions increasingly engage with Bitcoin through these new financial products, the potential for a significant impact on the cryptocurrency’s value trajectory is tangible.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "content": "U.Today - According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are displaying an intriguing profitability trend.\nIn a new tweet, Santiment noted that Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Ledger all have more than 80% of existing supplies in profit. This trend was last observed in March 2022. Bitcoin, ETH and XRP are presently marking 83%, 84% and 81% of their supplies in profit.\nThe \"Total Supply in Profit\" metric is an excellent way to determine how much the total supply on a network is up or down at any given time. This is a simple technique to determine whether a coin is worth more or less today than it was when it was initially minted, mined or entered circulation.\nMeanwhile, the percent of total supply in profit analyzes whether the percentage of supply available at any particular time, rather than the total number of coins on a network, is up or down at any given time. This represents a binary way of seeing the ratio of the total supply simply being in profit, even if it is a very small profit.\nThat said, Santiment states that BTC, XRP and ETH have their supplies at historically high-risk profit levels compared to their averages, which have been in the 55%-75% range since 2018.\nThe percentage of total supply in profit offers shorter-term perspectives on how the network is profiting or losing value on its investments over time.\nThis matters because crypto is a zero-sum game. When networks are heavily profiting, according to this metric, then it is imperative to watch out.\nThis does not rule out further upside moves for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to more exposure from ETFs and other positive news; however, there might be something else to watch out for.\nAccording to Santiment, a great signal to watch that would imply continued long-term growth would be a breach below 75% of their supplies in profit once again.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

            "time": "- Jan 28, 2024",
            "content": "U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.\nThe mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.\nETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.\nIt is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.\nA technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

In a significant development, shorts worth approximately $60 million have been liquidated, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment as we approach the weekend.\nAnalyzing the current charts, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, managing to sustain above the crucial support level of $40,000. The coin has recently experienced a rebound from this level, which has historically acted as a strong psychological barrier for both bulls and bears.\nSource: CoinglassIf BTC maintains its position above this support, the next key resistance to watch will be around $42,000, a level where we might expect some consolidation before a further push. On the downside, if the $40,000 level fails to hold, traders should look for potential support near the $38,500 region.\nEthereum, on the other hand, is also showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off. The coin has found support near the $2,100 mark, just above the 200-day exponential moving average, which is often considered a significant indicator of long-term trends.\nIf ETH can sustain this rebound, the immediate resistance is expected at $2,400. A breakthrough above this could open the path toward $2,500, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance. A fall below the current support level could see the price testing the next support zone around $2,000.\nThe liquidation heatmap provides additional context, illustrating the pressure on short sellers as the market moves against their positions. This liquidation is particularly evident in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen a significant number of short positions being closed in a short span of time.

            "content": "U.Today - The People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced a 50 basis point cut to the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR). It could infuse the market with a renewed sense of optimism, potentially catalyzing a bullish trend for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nThe reduction in the RRR is a clear signal from the central bank aimed at stimulating economic activity by freeing up liquidity within the banking sector. This liquidity, in turn, can flow into various markets, crypto included, providing a much-needed boost during times of uncertainty. The increased liquidity often translates to greater investment in risk assets, as investors search for higher yields, which could lead to an uptick in Bitcoin's value.\nFurthermore, the anticipated issuance of more short-term debt by the U.S. Treasury, aligned with expectations, may further fortify this bullish scenario. The rationale is twofold: firstly, the U.S. elections loom on the horizon, and maintaining a buoyant market environment could be advantageous for the current administration.\nSecondly, with rate cuts on the Federal Reserve's agenda, it is financially prudent for the Treasury to delay long-term debt in favor of shorter maturities, positioning for lower interest rates in the future.\nThese factors combined present a compelling case for a positive impact on Bitcoin or other digital assets. The expected increase in short-term debt issuance, designed to maintain liquidity, could result in more capital flowing into the crypto market as investors diversify their portfolios in search of higher returns amid a flush liquidity landscape.\nHowever, it is not just liquidity that is driving the narrative. The PBoC's RRR cut coincides with a significant stimulus package aimed at bolstering Chinese equities. As these markets rally, the risk appetite among investors grows, potentially spilling over into the crypto domain and uplifting Bitcoin's price as a result.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

The emergence of this event is notably poised to change the outlook of the entire market as it will force a slump in Bitcoin issuance rate, which might ultimately impact its price. Crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant has shed insight into the potential price target for the coin after the halving event.\nThe CryptoQuant analysis drew reference from the first three Bitcoin halving events, highlighting a common theme in terms of price action. The coin typically begins an uptrend a year before the halving event and continues on a bullish ride to hit a new high after the halving before entering a bearish phase.\nIn the first halving and second halving events, Bitcoin’s price soared from $2.48 and $269 a year before the event, soaring to a high of $1,131 and $2,518 about a year later. Similar trends surfaced in the third halving cycle of 2020 as the price moved from a low of $7,255 to a high of $56,615 a year after.\nAhead of this current halving cycle, Bitcoin’s price has been picking an uptrend since April of last year, and should history repeat itself, it would chart a more ambitious price that might see it surpass its all-time high (ATH) above $69,000.\n\nSince their emergence, spot Bitcoin ETF products have not helped price growth in general but rather have led to bouts of liquidations as funds flew out of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\nNonetheless, with Bitcoin halving, the ETF might serve as the needed piece to help trigger the next bull market cycle.\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"
