"2024-01-18 07:58:00","'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Kiyosaki Gives Epic Bitcoin Price Prediction","U.Today - In a stunning turn of events  the SEC's official X account faced a security breach on Tuesday. An unauthorized post claimed that the agency had greenlit the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF. However  SEC Chair Gary Gensler swiftly clarified that the agency had not approved any such ETFs  and the misleading post  now deleted  originated from an unauthorized user.Notably  Robert Kiyosaki  the acclaimed author of the best-selling book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad "" reacted to the news with significant commentary. Expressing enthusiasm for the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF  Kiyosaki highlighted his satisfaction with having invested in Bitcoin years ago. He boldly predicted a surge in Bitcoin's value to $150 000 shortly. Kiyosaki also foresaw a bullish trajectory for gold  attributing it to central banks' accumulating and holding the precious metal. In contrast  he anticipated a decline in silver prices as some sellers might liquidate their holdings to meet financial obligations amid rising inflation.Interestingly  Kiyosaki's optimistic outlook took a more cautious tone  suggesting a potential silver market crash. Despite the uncertainty  he declared it as a buying opportunity for silver stackers. Notably  Kiyosaki had earlier made even bolder forecasts  speculating that Bitcoin's price could soar to an unprecedented $1 million.Hack or misstep?Against the backdrop of this unexpected drama  the crypto industry is abuzz with speculation  questioning whether the compromised SEC tweet was the result of a hack or a mere mistake in post-dating. With the decision on the Bitcoin ETF looming  today's developments add an intriguing layer to an already tense situation  creating anticipation for the imminent resolution of this saga.This article was originally published on U.Today"

This equates to 600 quintillion guesses every second made in an attempt to solve the block puzzle.The rise in the Bitcoin hashrate stems from the excitement surrounding the launch of the first set of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S.After months of speculation  the Bitcoin asset class has entered a new era with the SEC's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs for listing and trading.Eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading Thursday morning  including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Bitcoin Trust  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF  among others  with $4.6 billion in shares changing hands shortly after.According to IntoTheBlock data  Bitcoin's on-chain volume has reached its highest level since the FTX collapse.

This sentiment is shared by exchange flows  which is currently reaching $4.6 billion in inflows/ outflows per day  indicating a growing increase in investor activity.Futures open interest is still high at $17.6 billion  with only 146 trading days since November 2020 registering a higher figure.At the time of writing  the BTC price was down 2.95% in the last 24 hours to $45 708 after attaining highs of $49 102 in yesterday's trading session.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Shares How Much BTC He Bought After ETF Approval, SHIB Erases Another Zero, Ripple CEO Celebrates SEC Approval: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - Here are the top three news stories presented to you by U.Today.""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" author reveals how much Bitcoin he bought after ETF approvalRobert Kiyosaki  financial guru and author of ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" world-bestselling book  has recently taken to X platform to make another pessimistic market forecast. In his post  Kiyosaki invited his followers to ponder over the possible implications of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve  and the PhDs in these governmental institutions  failing to save the economy. According to the author  if the U.S. dollar crashes  the United States is likely to fall into hyperinflation. ""That's why I bought 5 more Bitcoin today "" wrote Kiyosaki  promoting the world's largest crypto as a safe-haven asset in his usual manner. At the moment of writing  five BTCs are worth $230 355 (with Bitcoin trading at $46 071). Kiyosaki's purchase likely took place after the SEC greenlit for Bitcoin spot ETFs. As a reminder  the pivotal market development took place on Jan. 10  with the regulator approving 11 Bitcoin ETF applications  including those from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)  VanEck  Fidelity  Ark Invest and Grayscale.Shiba Inu (SHIB) erases another zeroYesterday  the Shiba Inu (SHIB) meme coin got rid of another zero in its price  to the great joy of the SHIB community. At the moment of writing  the meme coin is trading at $0.00001021  per CoinMarketCap. This achievement represents breaking barriers  reaching new peaks in market capitalization and gaining wider recognition in the crypto space. The SHIB token was one among many cryptocurrencies that saw their value increase following a significant move for the cryptocurrency industry anticipated for years - the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC. The positive decision of the regulator has injected a fresh wave of optimism onto the market  boosting the prices of various cryptocurrencies  including Shiba Inu. Meanwhile  SHIB lead Shytoshi Kusama unveiled his ambitious plan for the SHIB token's future  namely  the introduction of SHIB name tokens  which is aimed at bridging the gap between the traditional internet and Web 3.0.Ripple CEO celebrates SEC approvalIn a recent X post  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed the major milestone that has been on the lips of the entire crypto industry since Wednesday - the SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. ""The significance of this moment cannot be overstated "" wrote Garlinghouse  congratulating everyone who had worked to bring this anticipated outcome to reality. The CEO then underlined that the spot Bitcoin ETF approval is a monumental step toward the legitimization of cryptocurrencies as an asset class  expressing hope that the move will spur further institutional adoption and investment. He expects a shift in focus from speculative trading to broader  real-world use of cryptocurrency  further establishing its position as a legitimate asset class. Garlinghouse's post gained lots of attention from the X crypto community  hitting 9 500 likes and almost 500 comments.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","Bitcoin ETF Start Was 'Terribly Unsuccessful,' Says CNBC's Ran Neuner","U.Today - The grand debut of the Bitcoin ETF was met with mixed reactions  as reported by CNBC's Ran Neuner. The surface-level enthusiasm surrounding the $4.5 billion traded seems impressive  but a deeper analysis paints a different picture. The assertion of ""terrible unsuccessfulness"" arises from scrutinizing the composition of these trades  particularly highlighting that half of the $4.6 billion traded was tied to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and was predominantly marked by sales and outflows due to its higher fees and the dated nature of its locked-up Bitcoin.The trader suggests that instead of witnessing a flood of new capital onto the Bitcoin market  what occurred was largely an adjustment of existing positions. The crucial point here is the distinction between trade volume and new inflows  the latter being apparently negligible on the first day.Large accounts with substantial capital at their disposal tend to act with patience and precision. They are likely to avoid the initial frenzy of a new financial product's launch  waiting instead for the market to stabilize before committing significant funds. From this standpoint  the first day of trading  while not indicative of immediate success in terms of fresh inflows  is not necessarily a failure but rather a period of adjustment.Furthermore  the stability in Bitcoin's price  remaining within the $45 000 to $48 000 range even post-approval  suggests that the market is in a state of anticipation rather than reaction. This period could be seen as a stage of opportunity.Upon reflection  it seems premature to label the Bitcoin ETF launch as unsuccessful. While the initial inflows may not have met expectations  the infrastructure for large-scale investment is only just taking shape. The prudent strategy for experienced investors — waiting out initial volatility — is a classic approach that may yet bring substantial yields in the long-term future.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","Bitcoin to $1.5 Million? Ark Invest's Cathie Wood Makes Epic BTC Price Prediction","U.Today - The cryptocurrency industry is no stranger to bold predictions  but when Ark Invest's CEO Cathie Wood speaks  investors usually listen with more caution. With a reputation for forward-thinking investment strategies  Wood has set the bar high  positing a base case for Bitcoin at $600 000 and a bull case reaching an eye-watering $1.5 million by 2030.This prediction comes amid the surge of activity on the market  amplified by the launch of the spot BTC ETF. Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg ETF noted an unprecedented 700 000 individual transactions on the ETF's first day  signaling a strong demand for the recently launched product. Despite GBTC trading at a discount  indicative of potential selling and outflow  the collective trading volume across various funds  including IBIT  FBTC and ARKB  was a staggering $4.33 billion.BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewThe options market also tells a tale of considerable activity  with 36 000 BTC options set to expire  having a notional value of $1.68 billion. Ethereum is not far behind  with 262 000 options due  pointing toward dynamic market sentiment.Turning to Bitcoin's price chart  the market has witnessed a steadfast ascent  with the cryptocurrency consistently finding support above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs — a bullish signal for traders. Current movements suggest a healthy consolidation  with potential for upside continuation.So why does Cathie Wood believe Bitcoin could reach such astronomical levels? Wood's forecast hinges on several factors. First  the growing institutional adoption positions Bitcoin not just as a store of value for encryption enthusiasts but as a tool for institutional-grade risk diversification. Bitcoin's fixed supply cap at 21 million coins starkly contrasts with the inflating supply of fiat currencies  potentially driving its value as a deflationary asset.Bitcoin's network effect  where its value increases with the number of users and transactions on the blockchain  also bolsters Wood's prediction. Coupled with technological advancements and increased accessibility  Bitcoin's trajectory seems poised for continued growth.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","Ethereum (ETH) Shows Who's King of Alts","U.Today - Ethereum continues to assert its dominance  proving to investors and enthusiasts why it reigns supreme among altcoins. The recent price action of Ethereum paints a bullish narrative  with potential signals pointing toward an ongoing growth cycle that could redefine its market stature.Ethereum's market movement has been extremely dominant following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF  with the asset recently piercing through significant resistance levels. After a sustained period above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs  ETH has shown formidable strength. Currently  Ethereum's price hovers around $2 600  with the immediate resistance level now likely forming near the $2 700 mark  a point at which sellers previously stepped in. A decisive break above this level could open the gates for further escalation toward the $3 000 psychological barrier.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side  local support can be identified at around the $2 500 level  where a confluence of the EMAs and historical price reactions provides a safety net against potential pullbacks. Should Ethereum retreat from its current levels  the $2 400 and $2 300 levels stand ready to act as secondary and tertiary support zones  where buying interest has coalesced in the past.The backdrop to this vigorous market movement is the speculation regarding the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF. The recent green light for a Bitcoin spot ETF has amplified discussions around its Ethereum counterpart. Such approval would be a significant catalyst for Ethereum  potentially drawing in a new wave of institutional and retail investment.The primary strength of a spot Ethereum ETF lies in its direct exposure to the actual asset  rather than the derivatives market that futures-based ETFs represent. This means that an ETF would purchase actual Ethereum  providing direct support to its price and reflecting true market sentiment more accurately. Moreover  it would offer investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of managing cryptocurrency wallets and keys  thereby simplifying entry onto the crypto market.The approval of an Ethereum ETF would not only validate the asset's maturity and market significance but also solidify its position as a mainstay in the portfolios of diverse investors. Given Ethereum's foundational role in the development of DeFi and NFTs  an ETF would be a testament to its integral place in the digital economy.Spot Bitcoin ETF hereDespite the approval of one of the most long-awaited financial products for the cryptocurrency market  Bitcoin displayed a stoic reaction  subverting the expectations of many investors  who were bracing for a significant market upheaval. The cryptocurrency's price stability post-ETF news  while surprising to some  has been a more favorable outcome compared to the sell-off that many had predicted.The relative calmness in Bitcoin's price has provided a conducive backdrop for altcoins to shine. Ethereum (ETH) notably breached the $2 500 mark  and Solana (SOL) regained a $100 valuation  underscoring a night of triumph for alternative cryptocurrencies. This decoupling of Bitcoin's movement from altcoin performance is a phenomenon that has been increasingly observed  suggesting a maturing market where assets can thrive on individual merit and ecosystem developments.The chart at hand paints a picture of consolidation for Bitcoin  with the price hovering around the $45 000 region. The lack of a significant corrective move post-ETF news has lent a supportive floor to the broader crypto market. Trading volumes  alongside price action  indicate a steady holding pattern  a sign that the market is digesting the recent developments without panic or overenthusiasm.Despite the current stability  the market should not discount the potential for an uptick in Bitcoin’s value. Historically  actual capital inflow following such regulatory milestones has been a precursor to upward movements in the cryptocurrency's price. If history is to serve as a reference  the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may yet act as a delayed fuse  igniting a rally as new capital finds its way onto the market.Investors are advised to maintain cautious optimism. While current market conditions have not triggered the volatility many feared  the introduction of ETFs is a substantial change to the investment landscape of Bitcoin. As traditional investors and institutions increasingly engage with Bitcoin through these new financial products  the potential for a significant impact on the cryptocurrency’s value trajectory is tangible.

According to two anonymous sources cited by Reuters in its Wednesday report  the company is set to repurchase $285 million worth of shares from early investors and employees. Repurchasing shares is Ripple's strategic action aimed at bolstering investor confidence and asserting its financial stability. Investors are only allowed to sell up to 6% of their interest during a repurchase. This restriction is a savvy approach to maintaining a balanced shareholder structure. This is not the first time Ripple is venturing into buybacks. In early January 2022  the company had previously repurchased shares issued after securing $200 million in funding in 2019.This article was originally published on U.Today"

This halving event is slated to take place in April  and the Bitcoin block reward is bound to reduce by 50% to 3.125 BTC. Throughout history  there has been a major buying frenzy ahead of these halving events  underscoring the projection from PlanB.Later this year  PlanB expects the price of Bitcoin to soar beyond the all-time high (ATH) to a high of $100 000. It is worth noting that this price target has been PlanB’s call for some time now. The difference this time is the presence of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) following the historic approval granted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Jan. 10.In the long term  PlanB said he expects the price of the top cryptocurrency to touch a high of $532 000. The veteran trader pegged the timeline for this extremely bullish price call in 2025. As revealed in the accompanying YouTube Video  PlanB backed his price forecasts using his iconic Stock-2-Flow model  thus granting additional legitimacy to the projections as a whole.PlanB’s has relatively conservative outlookBullish as the call from PlanB is  it is relatively conservative when compared to other major Bitcoin bulls like Samson Mow.The top Bitcoin investor believes the spot Bitcoin ETF products will catalyze the price of Bitcoin to $1 million per coin in the long term.

According to Mow  Bitcoin reaching $1 million may happen any day from now  and this sudden price surge will be “max pain” for most market participants. He explained that many companies  including his own  Jan3  have many plans and meetings scheduled for the year 2024  and should Bitcoin spike to $1 million  it would “derail everything.” Apart from Jan3  Mow named other big figures in the crypto space who would see their plans collapse in the event that BTC suddenly reached $1 million: analyst Plan B and his stock-to-flow model for Bitcoin  MicroStrategy with its goal to accumulate 1% of the Bitcoin supply and El Salvador  as it would not be able to issue Bitcoin bonds and buy more BTC below the $100 000 level.Dogecoin (DOGE) whale transfers 332.9 million DOGE to BinanceAccording to data provided by Whale Alert's X account  yesterday  a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale moved a large amount of dog-themed tokens to Binance.

The surge in profitability comes amid a roller coaster 24 hours for Bitcoin  marked by a false report of official approval of the first U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF  leading to whipsaw price movements.As of the latest data  the current price of Bitcoin stands at $45 488  representing a 2.25% decline in the past 24 hours. The tumultuous ride began when a hacker exploited a SIM swap attack to publish a misleading announcement on the SEC’s X account (formerly Twitter)  falsely claiming the regulatory approval of the much-anticipated Bitcoin ETF.This misinformation triggered a sharp surge in Bitcoin's price  reaching a high of $47 901  before swiftly retracting to its current levels. Representatives from the platform revealed that the post was the result of a security breach  emphasizing the vulnerability of even major platforms to sophisticated attacks.Bitcoin market dynamicsThe false approval announcement added to the existing anticipation surrounding a positive SEC decision on Bitcoin spot ETFs  a development expected to attract billions in new investments to the crypto market. This anticipation has been a driving force behind Bitcoin's price rally over the past two months  despite the recent dip in value.Despite price fluctuations  the IntoTheBlock data revealing that around 90% of Bitcoin holding addresses are currently in profit is seen as a bullish sign for the leading cryptocurrency. This statistic underscores the resilience of long-term investors who have weathered the market's volatility and underscores the potential for sustained growth.It is expected that the profitability of holders could further attract institutional investors and strengthen Bitcoin's position as a store of value. As Bitcoin continues to navigate the regulatory landscape and faces occasional bouts of volatility  the recent surge in profitability serves as a testament to the resilience of the cryptocurrency and the optimism prevailing among its dedicated community of investors.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Shares Crucial Bitcoin (BTC) Chart","U.Today - A fake Bitcoin ETF announcement led to a sudden surge in Bitcoin's price to $48 000  which just as quickly plummeted to $45 000 as the truth came to light. Peter Brandt shared a chart with a yet unseen ""pattern"" dedicated to SEC Chair Gery Gensler.Brandt's chart  humorously labeled ""The Gensler Grunt "" shows a stark candlestick formation that characterizes the wild event. The pattern indicates a significant sell-off following the peak  as traders realized the ETF approval announcement was a hoax. What stands out in Brandt's analysis is the market's knee-jerk reaction to the news  and the following correction aligns with the classic ""buy the rumor  sell the news"" behavior.From a technical standpoint  the chart reflects local strengths and weaknesses of Bitcoin. Before the surge  Bitcoin was showing a consolidation pattern  trading sideways as the market sought direction. The abrupt spike  followed by an equally rapid decline  illustrates the fragility of the current market sentiment  heavily influenced by news and rumors.The ""pattern"" depicted by Brandt can be seen as a short-term bullish trap  where early buyers anticipating a positive outcome from the fake news were caught off guard by the sudden reversal. This could indicate weakness on the market  as there was not enough bullish momentum to maintain higher price levels once the fake announcement was debunked.What this chart and Brandt's interpretation suggest is that Bitcoin is yet to be truly tested. The quick recovery from the dip shows resilience  but the inability to hold onto the gains suggests caution. Traders should be wary of the market's current sensitivity to news  which could lead to overreactions in both directions.Despite the joking nature of the tweet  it accurately reflects the entire situation and how it was resolved. However  investors and traders should view the provided chart with a bit of irony and avoid making any serious investment decisions based on it.This article was originally published on U.Today"

This development has raised fresh concerns about whether the market regulator will go ahead with its plans to approve the product as anticipated by the community.What comes next?Hacks of high-profile government accounts on popular social media platforms like X are not uncommon. As confirmed by the market regulator  it has launched an investigation into the attack  with plans to cooperate with law enforcement agencies.With trust in the SEC's X account now compromised  it remains uncertain whether today’s projected timeline for spot Bitcoin ETF approval is still feasible. However  Fox Business Network’s Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino noted that  based on precedent  it would be quite rare for the market regulator to get as far as the stage it is in with Bitcoin ETF applications and deny the proposals altogether.In line with the hack  many in the crypto ecosystem are nursing the idea of a conspiracy theory  noting that the accident might have been orchestrated so that there would be new grounds for denial of the spot Bitcoin ETF application. While this school of thought will be substantiated in the launched investigation  the expectation is that the approval will proceed as planned.Bitcoin lying in wait for rallyThe Bitcoin price temporarily rallied above $47 890 following the fake news of the approvals. The coin has dropped and is now changing hands for $45 859.90  down 2.07% in the past 24 hours. The digital currency is likely to see its major breakout moment if an officially certified update about the spot Bitcoin ETF approval is issued.One of the core projections for a Bitcoin price surge came from Samson Mow  who foresees a $1 000 000 price tag in the long term.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","Peter Schiff Releases Crucial Bitcoin (BTC) Warning That Might Make Sense","U.Today - A sudden spike in Bitcoin's price to near $48 000 was abruptly followed by a plunge to around $45 000  after a post by a hacked SEC Twitter account falsely announced the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Renowned Bitcoin and crypto skeptic Peter Schiff has chimed in with a cautionary warning on the situation. Schiff suggests that with the market's anticipation of an actual Bitcoin ETF approval looming  the recent volatility might be a precursor to a more substantial market disappointment.He posits that the hack-induced spike and subsequent correction may not be an isolated incident and that the market's tendency to defy speculative expectations could mean that the actual approval  if it happens  will not necessarily translate into the bullish run investors are hoping for.Schiff's advice to investors is to consider selling today  rather than waiting for the market to potentially ""disappoint"" upon the real news. This stance  while typically bearish and in line with Schiff's overall sentiment toward Bitcoin  may resonate with traders who try to avoid unnecessary risks.Schiff's warning points to the possibility of an ""overbought"" scenario where the hype leading up to the approval has already been priced in  and the actual event could trigger profit-taking rather than further buying.The underlying message in Schiff’s warning is one of caution. Traders and investors might do well to consider the preexisting market dynamic and the fact that the crypto market has often moved counter to the majority's expectations  especially in the context of high-stakes regulatory developments.The next few days could prove to be a critical test of whether Bitcoin can sustain its rally after the approval of the long-awaited product or  as Schiff suggests  the market is setting up for a letdown.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","Elon Musk-and-Bitcoin-Themed Statement Issued by Samson Mow: Details","U.Today - Founder and chief executive of Bitcoin-focused company Jan3 Samson Mow has posted a cat meme  mentioning Elon Musk and Bitcoin maximalist Preston Pysh and poking fun at the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO for his criticism of the Bitcoin consensus algorithm.Elon Musk  rocket science and PoWSamson Mow accompanied his meme with a comment  stating: “Proof of Work isn't rocket science. But it might as well be!”This refers to Elon Musk's statements made before his acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022. While he claimed that he wanted to acquire Twitter to preserve the “town square for free speech ” the legacy media began heavily criticizing him with articles whose titles were worded something like “Elon Musk Is Finding Out That Free Speech Isn’t Rocket Science” (an article by The New York Times).However  Mow’s tweet bears a reference not only to that but also to the criticism of the proof-of-work consensus algorithm on that Bitcoin runs. In early 2021  Musk shocked the cryptocurrency community and the financial world by announcing that Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and started to accept Bitcoin payments for its electric automobiles. It happened in February. However  in April  Musk closed down that payment option  expressing concerns about Bitcoin mining based on the proof-of-work algorithm being harmful to the environment.Back then  many Bitcoiners pointed out that the original meme cryptocurrency  Dogecoin  supported by Musk so much is also based on the proof-of-work algorithm  but Musk never responded to them.SpaceX still holds BitcoinHe stated that Tesla will resume accepting Bitcoin once BTC miners around the world begin basing at least 50% of their operations on renewable energy. This level of green technology usages was achieved in the same year. However  Tesla still has not reinstated Bitcoin as a payment option.Still  earlier this week  Musk shared on a podcast that SpaceX continues to hold Bitcoin  and he still holds his DOGE. Nothing was mentioned about Tesla  but as reported earlier  the e-car producing giant has been gradually selling its Bitcoin stash but is believed to still be holding some BTC.This week  Bitcoin took a major step forward as the SEC regulator finally approved 11 filings on opening spot Bitcoin ETFs submitted by various Wall Street giants last year.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","Ethereum (ETH) Loses Fight Against Bitcoin (BTC): No Alt Season?","U.Today - The Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio is a critical metric that is important to constantly monitor if you are operating with altcoins. This ratio signifies Ethereum's value relative to Bitcoin  and its movements can indicate general trends on the market. Recently  the ETH/BTC chart has shown a significant downtrend  which suggests that Bitcoin retains its dominance in the cryptocurrency space.The chart illustrates that Ethereum has not been able to outpace Bitcoin in terms of investment returns. This is particularly significant for investors who aim to ""beat"" the market by selecting assets that could potentially yield higher returns than Bitcoin. Currently  the performance of Ethereum  when measured against Bitcoin  has been less than stellar  indicating that Bitcoin remains the market leader and a stronger investment choice in the cryptocurrency realm.ETH/BTC Chart by TradingViewDespite this  Ethereum has shown solid performance against the U.S. dollar  with an approximate 10% increase since December. This resilience in the face of a falling ETH/BTC ratio highlights Ethereum's inherent strengths and its ability to maintain value independently of Bitcoin's market movements. This divergence between Ethereum's performance in USD terms versus its value relative to Bitcoin could suggest that while Bitcoin may lead the market  Ethereum continues to offer value to investors.The current state of the ETH/BTC chart raises the question: is an alt season  where alternative cryptocurrencies surge in value  imminent? Traditionally  alt seasons occur when altcoins gain significantly against both Bitcoin and the USD  but the current data suggests that the market may not be close to it.Solana heats upAs we move into 2024  Solana (SOL) is facing its first significant challenge of the year. After riding the highs of a bullish rally  SOL has entered a period of correction over the past two weeks  with prices retracting from their recent peaks. The current price movement shows SOL approaching a local trendline resistance level  which could be a defining moment for the cryptocurrency. This trendline  drawn from recent highs  has been a barrier to SOL's price progression. A breakthrough at this point could signal the resumption of the bullish rally that Solana has been known for  suggesting a strong start to the year and reinforcing investor confidence in the asset's long-term prospects.The possibility of a breakout is bolstered by the broader context of the crypto market's recovery after a challenging period. A successful push beyond the trendline could attract more buyers  potentially leading to an increase in trading volume and more sustained upward movement.If Solana will be unable to push past the trendline resistance  the next level of support lies at the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The 26 EMA has historically provided a cushion during retracements  acting as a stepping stone for future rallies. If SOL's price were to retract to this moving average  it could offer a secondary point of entry for investors looking to capitalize on the asset's retracing.Bonk suddenly wakes upThe Solana meme coin Bonk has staged an impressive rally. Over recent trading sessions  BONK has seen its value surge by more than 30%. The BONK token was most recently labeled as the ""Shiba Inu"" of Solana. Its price action mostly reflects the bullish tendencies we saw on the market pushed by the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. The ETF approval has not only upheld the market's confidence but also potentially paved the way for increased institutional participation.The recovery of BONK coincides with a pivotal moment on the crypto market  as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are also witnessing a bullish trend reversal. The market's shift toward a more positive outlook is a notable change from the correction we saw recently  where many assets struggled to maintain their value amid regulatory uncertainty and market volatility.A closer analysis of the provided chart reveals that BONK's price has rebounded sharply  now trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving average — key indicators that often signal strong bullish sentiment. The moving averages are sloping upward  confirming the momentum behind BONK's unexpected rise. Moreover  the increased trading volume accompanying this uptick in price points to an influx of investors who are driving the rally.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 07:58:00","Bitcoin (BTC) Witnesses Half Billion Worth of Whale Activity With One Secret Transfer","U.Today - In the last 24 hours  the crypto market has once again demonstrated its dynamic nature  with a particular focus on Bitcoin (BTC). The highlight of this period was the official commencement of spot Bitcoin ETF trading on the U.S. stock market. This development marked a significant milestone in the crypto space  coinciding with the 15th anniversary of Hal Finney's iconic tweet.Against the backdrop of this historic event  the crypto market experienced a surge in activity  particularly in the movement of Bitcoin  with transactions totaling almost half a billion dollars  according to Whale Alert. Notably  thousands of tokens were shuffled across major exchanges  including Kraken  Binance and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN)  as well as various unknown wallets.Secret Bitcoin transferHowever  amid the myriad transactions  one mysterious transfer stood out – 4 361 BTC  equivalent to a staggering $200.54 million  migrated discreetly from one undisclosed wallet to another. The secrecy surrounding this substantial transfer has left the crypto community intrigued  sparking speculation and debate within the industry.This enigmatic movement of funds adds an air of mystique to an already eventful day in the crypto sphere. The question on everyone's mind is: what could be the motive behind such a significant and clandestine transfer?Speculation runs rife as to whether this move was orchestrated by a major Bitcoin miner or a prominent investor. The sheer magnitude of the transaction suggests a potential influence on market trends  particularly with the weekend approaching.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 08:00:00","Can Solana (SOL) Continue Its Path Up in 2024?","U.Today - As we traverse into 2024  the trajectory of Solana becomes a pivotal question for the cryptocurrency market. A glance at the Solana chart reveals strong growth  followed by a recent phase of correction. The moving averages have aligned in a manner that suggests a strong bullish trend with the price consistently staying above these indicators.However  SOL has recently experienced a pullback  hinting at a period of consolidation. This could be attributed to active profit-taking from venture capitalists (VCs)  which was a foreseen event given the asset’s substantial appreciation over the past months. The retracement is also part of the natural market cycle following such an impressive rally.SOL/USDT chart by TradingViewThe Solana ecosystem has seen significant growth  particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the proliferation of meme coins. The rapid expansion of DeFi on Solana has been fueled by its high transaction throughput and relatively low fees  making it a competitive environment for DeFi applications. The meme coin phenomenon has also found a foothold on Solana  attracting both positive attention for its viral nature and negative scrutiny due to the high magnitude of scams and market manipulations associated with this niche.While these factors have contributed to Solana’s visibility and adoption  they have also led to increased volatility. The ecosystem's resilience is being tested as it navigates the fallout from various high-profile scams and manipulative practices  most notably within the meme coin market. These events have triggered skepticism among investors  as they weigh the platform's innovative potential against the risks posed by these malicious activities.Looking forward  for Solana to continue its upward path  the ecosystem will need to address these challenges head-on. Enhancements in security protocols  more rigorous vetting of projects and an overall shift toward more sustainable and utility-driven applications will be critical. The network's capability to scale effectively  maintain uptime and foster a secure environment for both DeFi and other applications will be key determinants of its trajectory.Despite the current correction and associated challenges  the fundamentals of Solana  especially its blockchain's architecture designed for speed and efficiency  remain strong. If the community and developers can collaborate to bolster the network's robustness against scams and ensure a more stable platform  Solana has the potential to resume its upward trend. The path forward for SOL will likely hinge on its ability to mature as an ecosystem  prioritizing security and long-term utility over the transient hype of meme coins and speculative ventures.New year for EthereumAs Ethereum (ETH) steps into 2024  its market position appears to be on the cusp of transformation. The past year has seen significant developments within the Ethereum ecosystem  notably the expansion of Layer 2 (L2) networks and the unveiling of a refreshed road map by Vitalik Buterin  presenting a new vision for the platform. These changes may have set the stage for a potential price reversal for Ethereum as it continues to navigate its current rally.The price chart of Ethereum indicates a mixed scenario. After a period of bullish trend  ETH is showing signs of consolidation. The moving averages are providing support at lower levels  and the price is oscillating around these key indicators  suggesting a balancing act between bullish optimism and bearish caution.The L2 networks  like Arbitrum and Optimism  have been a beacon of growth  with transaction volume skyrocketing by 90 times compared to 2021. This incredible expansion signifies a shift in focus to scalability and efficiency. The L2 solutions are not just a technical improvement but also a strategic realignment  positioning Ethereum to better handle the burgeoning demands of DeFi  NFTs and other blockchain applications.Buterin's new Ethereum vision  which emphasizes single slot finality  cross-rollup standards and the inclusion of Verkle trees  points to a more secure  efficient and scalable network. The road map update also hints at long-term improvements to Ethereum's architecture  ensuring its place at the forefront of blockchain innovation.Despite these promising developments  Ethereum's price rally has been lagging when compared to some of its competitors. This underperformance could be due to market dynamics that have seen investors chase higher yields elsewhere. However  the solid rise in traction on L2 networks suggests that the groundwork is being laid for a more robust and expansive ecosystem.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 08:00:00","Top Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2024","U.Today - In this guide  we are going to discuss some large-cap cryptocurrencies that might be worth the attention of newbies and pro investors. As the crypto segment is gaining momentum after the 2021-2022 crypto winter  large-caps are among the most obvious opportunities on digital asset markets.Top cryptos to watch in 2024: HighlightsThe largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are responsible for over 85% of the aggregated crypto sphere market cap.While low-cap and mid-cap altcoins can provide more lucrative investment opportunities  the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap are less volatile and  therefore  more predictable on every stage of the crypto market cycle.Bitcoin (BTC) is likely to remain the largest crypto by market cap; the community is waiting for a new rally to happen in 2024-2025.Ethereum (ETH) will retain its status as the largest smart contracts platform of paramount importance for the entire DeFi ecosystem.The status of potential securities in U.S. jurisdictions will not affect the popularity of Cardano (ADA)  Solana (SOL)  Avalanche (AVAX)  Chainlink (LINK) and so on  while Polygon (MATIC) will be replaced by POL as the core token of the Polygon ecosystem.U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) will likely remain the two dominant stablecoins  though USDC might be replaced by Dai (DAI)  the largest decentralized stablecoin.The legal statuses of XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) are now much more optimistic than a year ago as Ripple and Binance teams managed to get by with little blood in the savage battles with U.S. regulators.Core cryptocurrencies of leading Ethereum-based L2 platforms Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) will remain in the spotlight for the global community.Despite the fact that the craziest days of the meme coin frenzy are gone  Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) will keep their audiences.At the same time  we might not be aware of “the next big things” of the upcoming big bull run: Dozens of projects with solid fundamentals and aggressive marketing are yet to be revealed to the general public.What are cryptocurrencies?Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate on a decentralized network or blockchain. Technically  a blockchain is a sort of distributed database that records and verifies transactions across multiple computers.Cryptocurrencies are distinct from traditional fiat currencies as they are not regulated by a central authority  offering a form of financial autonomy and privacy. They can be used for a variety of purposes  including investment  remittances and as a means of payment. The value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile  and their legal status varies across countries. Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009  cryptocurrencies have sparked significant interest and debate regarding their impact on the global financial system.What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin (BTC) is the first blockchain and  therefore  the first-ever cryptocurrency. It was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin (BTC) vision was realized in 2009  when its implementation was released as open-source software.Bitcoin (BTC) operates on a peer-to-peer network  allowing users to transact directly without an intermediary like a bank. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. The Bitcoin (BTC) supply is capped at 21 million coins. Its security and integrity are preserved by a sophisticated process dubbed Bitcoin (BTC) mining or finding hashes of Bitcoin (BTC) blocks by high-performance computers.What are altcoins?Altcoins (short for “alternative coins”) should be referred to as cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC). They emerged after Bitcoin's (BTC) success  offering variations or improvements on its technology and use case. Altcoins vary widely in their purposes  from replicating Bitcoin's model with slight changes to providing completely new functionalities  such as smart contracts  privacy enhancements  or different consensus mechanisms like proof-of-stake.Ethereum (ETH) was the first mainstream altcoin with programmable functions. Some altcoins aim to address perceived limitations of Bitcoin  such as transaction speed or energy efficiency.Top cryptos to watch in 2024: Full listIn the following index  we are going to display some cryptocurrencies with obvious potential in 2024 and demonstrate their pros and cons.Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency and the largest digital asset by market capitalization. Despite being surpassed technically by the majority of altcoins in terms of speed  throughput and resource-efficiency  Bitcoin (BTC) remains the dominant cryptocurrency. In the past years  it evolved into a mature asset compared to Gold  S&P500 Index and so on.Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on log scale // Image by CoinMarketCapIn 2024  Bitcoin (BTC) is set to undergo its fourth halving: Block rewards for miners will be reduced by 50%. This means that BTC as an asset becomes scarcer than ever before. Typically  such events (in 2016 and 2020) were interpreted as bullish catalysts for the Bitcoin (BTC) price. Also  the potential approval of a Bitcoin-based ETF in the U.S. might catalyze a new phase of capital injection into the asset.Ethereum (ETH) in 2024Launched in 2015  Ethereum (ETH) is the largest smart contracts platform. It means that it acts as a distributed computations platform for decentralized applications  a class of cryptocurrency software programs. Although Ethereum (ETH) is lagging behind many of its analogues when it comes to transactional throughput  it still retains the status of the safest and longest-running blockchain for dApps. Also  it is the backbone of L2 solutions’ ecosystem.In 2024  Ethereum (ETH) will see the activation of EIP 4844 or “proto-danksharding ” an upgrade that will increase throughput and lower transaction costs by 600%. Also  the implementation of “account abstraction” and zero-knowledge technologies on Ethereum (ETH) is underway. As a result  the community is optimistic about its midterm prospects.Tether (USDT) in 2024U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) by Tether Limited is the largest stablecoin  i.e.  cryptocurrency with its price pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is minted by a centralized entity that controls the basket of assets that is “backing” the circulating USDT supply. As of printing time  its market cap exceeded a whopping $90 billion.Tether (USDT) market cap soared by almost 50% in 2023 // Image by CoinMarketCapIn 2023  USDT made its portfolio way more conservative: It increased the share of cash and its equivalents and U.S. T-bills. This results in stability of USDT  but the platform remains unaudited. Tether (USDT) only publishes “attestations” to prove sufficiency of reserves.Polygon (MATIC) in 2024Polygon (MATIC) initially launched as the first mainstream second-layer platform on top of Ethereum (ETH): It bundles multiple transactions into a single data structure before validating them on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet. This allows Polygon (MATIC) users to enjoy Ethereum’s level of stability and reliability  but paying reduced fees and at a much higher speed.In 2024  Polygon (MATIC) will remain the leader of L2 innovation on Ethereum: It acquired a number of zero-knowledge tech startups to offer the most secure and cost-efficient experience. At the same time  within the massive Polygon 2.0 upgrade  the MATIC asset will be replaced by POL  a token for Polygon's staking design.Binance Coin (BNB) in 2024Binance Coin (BNB) is the core native cryptocurrency of Binance (BNB)  the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world  and BNB Smart Chain  an Ethereum-like smart contracts platform. Initially launched on Ethereum (ETH) for Binance ICO  it then migrated to the native blockchain and is now used as a utility token and an optimal fees instrument on Binance (BNB).The BNB price in 2024 will be affected by the outcome of the legal battle between former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and U.S. regulators. In November 2023  Changpeng Zhao agreed to pay record-breaking fees and step down as CEO. However  the verdict on his personal trial is yet to be announced.Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2024Launched back in 2013 as a fork of Litecoin (LTC)  Dogecoin (DOGE) is the first-ever memetic cryptocurrency. It means that it is based on a semi-ironic ethos and a funny narrative instead of innovation and tech disruption. Dogecoin (DOGE) commemorates Kabosu Shiba Inu dog from the 2013 internet meme.Dogecoin (DOGE) logo // Image by DogecoinAs the new spike of Dogecoin (DOGE) popularity was triggered by shilling on Elon Musk’s accounts  announcements of Starlink  Starship  X and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) products might catalyze new rallies of the Dogecoin (DOGE) price in 2024. At the same time  just like many other meme coins  Dogecoin (DOGE) is subject to increased volatility.Cardano (ADA) in 2024Cardano (ADA) is the second-largest proof-of-stake (PoS) network and one of the most decentralized blockchain networks in the Web3 segment by various indicators. Introduced by Charles Hoskinson in 2017  Cardano (ADA) released staking and smart contracts in the previous bull run.DeFi ecosystem of Cardano (ADA) sees its TVL soaring // Image by DeFiLlamaFor Cardano (ADA)  the upcoming rally will be the first one it will meet equipped with a growing dApps ecosystem. Despite much criticism from Ethereum (ETH) maximalists  it gained traction in the NFT and DeFi segments. The net TVL of Cardano-based dApps exceeds $255 million  getting closer to multi-month highs.XRP in 2024XRP  the core native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger blockchain is a veteran digital asset known since 2012. Its popularity is associated with Ripple Inc.  a U.S.-based fintech heavyweight. Ripple uses XRP as a medium of exchange in its numerous cross-border payments systems known as “on-demand liquidity corridors.”Since December 2020  Ripple and its directors have been accused of illegally selling unregistered securities to U.S. citizens in the form of XRP. However  as Ripple scored a major legal win in Q3  2023  the prospects for the XRP price in 2024 might be optimistic. At the same time  the process is very far from being over.Optimism (OP) in 2024Optimism (rebranded as OP Mainnet in 2023  but still known under its initial name) is one of the largest second-layer platforms on top of Ethereum (ETH). It means that it indexes transaction data and verifies it on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet in compressed form to save its computational capacity.Despite the savage rivalry in the L2s segment  Optimism remains a smart bet for dApps thanks to low transactional fees  detailed documentation and the “network effect.” Also  its team released OP Stack  an instrument for the development of Optimism-like commercial blockchains by third parties.Solana (SOL) in 2024SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana  a proof-of-history blockchain launched in 2019. Thanks to advanced tech design  it can process thousands of transactions per second for negligible fees. At the same time  in the past  the network went through a series of painful outages and received strong criticism.In 2024  Solana (SOL) is expected to get rid of its “FTX Legacy”: Many products incubated by FTX and its associated trading platform Alameda Research were running on Solana (SOL). As such  SOL might be in the spotlight for the next bull run as it has managed to keep its large and passionate community.Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2024Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous team  Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the second largest meme cryptocurrency inspired by the success of Dogecoin (DOGE). The token started as a typical “meme coin ” but step by step it evolved into a full-stack ecosystem with its own exchange  dApps and even a native Polygon-like L2 blockchain.At the same time  the success of SHIB in 2024 will depend on the overall status of meme coins. Major technical and community announcements might catalyze the SHIB price as well as periodical token burn reports  but these spikes are unlikely to be sustainable.USD Coin (USDC) in 2024Developed by U.S. conglomerate Circle  USD Coin (USDC) is the second largest USD-pegged stablecoin. As of early 2024  its market capitalization equals $24.4 billion in equivalent. The USDC cryptocurrency is natively available on all mainstream smart contract platforms and is listed by top cryptocurrency exchanges.USDC's capitalization started shrinking in March 2023 amid rumors about its fund insufficiency caused by the insolvency of Silvergate and other crypto-friendly banks in the U.S. At the same time  in Q3-Q4  2023  the team of the stablecoin made a number of hyped tech announcements  so USDC will likely remain a reliable modern alternative to Tether (USDT).Arbitrum (ARB) in 2024Arbitrum (ARB) by Offchain Labs is a dominant second-layer platform on top of Ethereum (ETH). It is responsible for over 51% of all value deposited to second-layer platforms on top of Ethereum (ETH). Hundreds of dApps have been deployed to Arbitrum (ARB) since its launch in mainnet in August 2021.Arbitrum (ARB) remains dominant Ethereum’s L2 // Image by L2BeatIn general  the Ethereum (ETH) community is optimistic about the prospects of the Arbitrum (ARB) price for 2024. The token underpins the leading L2 platform that recently introduced Arbitrum Stylus  a protocol designed to move the Arbitrum (ARB) blockchain beyond the Solidity programming language. With Stylus  developers of Rust and C++ will also be able to run their dApps on Ethereum Virtual Machine.Tron (TRX) in 2024Launched in mainnet in 2018  Tron (TRX) was the second-largest blockchain by TVL behind Ethereum (ETH) for years. It gained popularity thanks to very cheap transactions  fast block finality and stable performance. Tron (TRX) is part of the ecosystem of cryptocurrency services associated with Justin Sun  who is also the owner of BitTorrent and the HTX exchange (formerly Huobi).In 2024  Tron (TRX) will remain the dominant blockchain for USDT transfers: Over 50% of the aggregated USDT supply is issued on top of the Tron (TRX) blockchain. Meanwhile  Justin Sun will face severe legal pressure in 2024: Troubles with U.S. regulators might be an obstacle for TRX's growth.Chainlink (LINK) in 2024Chainlink (LINK) is the first-ever decentralized network of blockchain oracles. It facilitates the transfer of data between on-chain applications (dApps) and off-chain systems (weather trackers  points of sales and so on). As such  Chainlink (LINK) is a critically important service for integrating blockchains into real-world economies. LINK  the core native cryptocurrency of Chainlink (LINK)  gained much traction in the 2020-2021 bull run.In 2024  Chainlink's (LINK) growth might yet again be catalyzed by an array of solid partnerships or an aggressive social media promotion campaign by “LINK marines ” a group of passionate Chainlink (LINK) supporters.Top cryptos for 2024: NumbersLet’s summarize basic information about the most popular mainstream crypto coins to watch in 2024: names  tickers  price performance  market capitalization.NNameTickerMarket Cap  B USDDown from ATH  %1BitcoinBTC83338.42EthereumETH26954.13TetherUSDT92N/A4PolygonMATIC869.65Binance CoinBNB4656.66DogecoinDOGE1387.47CardanoADA2280.28XRPXRP3481.79OptimismOP313.310SolanaSOL4856.911Shiba InuSHIB687.512USD CoinUSDC25N/A13ArbitrumARB284.714TronTRX954.915ChainlinkLINK971.1In total  the aggregated capitalization of the cryptocurrency segment is $1.73 trillion  which is 43.2% lower compared to the all-time high registered in November 2021.Wrapping upThe cryptocurrency segment meets 2024 with cautious optimism. In general  the segment is waiting for the approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs  the fourth Bitcoin (BTC) halving  the EIP 4844 upgrade on Ethereum  the MATIC-to-POL migration in Polygon  the end of legal battles Binance  Ripple and Tron are involved in. The outcomes of these processes might either trigger the next bull run or ruin it.The meme coin segment might be overshadowed by new trending narratives (real-world assets  liquid staking  AI coins and so on)  while stablecoins will struggle with macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory hostility.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 08:00:00","Ethereum (ETH) Has to Break This Major Resistance Ahead of $2,500","U.Today - Ethereum is showing a steady performance on the market  approaching a critical resistance level at $2 400. Breaking this resistance level should push the asset closer to $2 500  especially if investors avoid a sell-off.The Relative Strength Index is providing hints that the current trend could continue. The RSI  positioned above the median line but not yet in overbought territory  suggests that there might be more room for upward movement before the asset becomes overextended.ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewAs Ethereum tests this local resistance  the cryptocurrency community is eagerly anticipating regulatory decisions that could impact the broader market. One of the main catalysts for Ethereum  and indeed the wider cryptocurrency market  is the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF or a Bitcoin spot ETF.The approval of a spot ETF has been a long-awaited event within the sector. An ETF  or Exchange-Traded Fund  allows investors to buy shares that represent the value of the underlying asset  in this case  Ethereum  without the need to hold the cryptocurrency itself. This eases entry for investors who are interested in the asset class but are hesitant to deal with the complexities of cryptocurrency ownership  storage and security.As Ethereum hovers near this resistance level  market observers are monitoring the asset's ability to maintain its upward trajectory and break through the $2 400 price point. A successful breach of this level could pave the way for further gains  possibly leading toward the $2 500 mark.Cardano finally broke throughCardano has often been described as a project that moves cautiously  lagging behind the market  but the most recent breakthrough could be an indication of an upcoming disruptive performance.The chart suggests that Cardano has reached a pivotal point. After a period of consolidation  ADA's price appears to be making a decisive move. The formation of a converging pattern  typically indicative of a price breakout  can be seen. Notably  the price has pushed above the upper trend line of this pattern  hinting at a potential continuation of the rally.Analyzing the moving averages  we notice a bullish setup  with the price trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This is often interpreted as a positive signal  as it reflects a strong underlying trend with sustained buying interest. The gap between the moving averages and the current price also adds to this bullish narrative.The volume bars do not show a substantial increase  suggesting that the breakout might not have fully captured the market's attention yet. A rise in trading volume would typically confirm a breakout  indicating increased conviction among traders.Solana's ability to continueSolana (SOL) has experienced a remarkable market run  capturing the attention of the cryptocurrency community. As the asset continues to gain traction  analysts and investors closely observe its price action for signs of sustainability or reversal. Currently  Solana shows signs that the tide may be turning  with a critical pattern emerging on its chart.The price movement has recently formed what is known as a lower high  often interpreted as one of the initial indicators of a potential correction. This technical pattern occurs when the price peaks at a level lower than the previous high  signaling a decrease in the momentum that has been driving the bull market.The significance of the lower high is underscored when placed within the context of the asset's recent performance. While the overall trajectory for Solana has been upward  this development suggests that traders and investors might be becoming more cautious  potentially leading to a shift in market sentiment.Volume  a key factor in confirming trend reversals  appears to have lessened as the lower high formed  which may indicate a reduction in buying pressure. Additionally  the Relative Strength Index (RSI)  while still at a relatively high level  has begun to show divergence  indicating a weakening in the current trend's strength.This article was originally published on U.Today"

The crypto market witnessed a slump after speculations arose about MatrixPort's bearish prediction for Bitcoin spot ETF approval.Amid the current slump seen on the ETH price  crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that Ethereum is still showing momentum but has a big gap to traverse to be at the same level as Bitcoin. Ethereum might see a bit of consolidation before continuing toward $3 000–$3 500 during Q1  2024.Expectations for Ethereum in 2024Starting with the Dencun hard fork  2024 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the Ethereum network.At the end of 2023  Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum roadmap going forward  conceding that there are only small differences from the previous year.Buterin stated in a series of posts on X (previously Twitter) that Ethereum's sustained focus in 2024 will be on six essential components. Buterin expounded on these six parts — Merge  Surge  Scourge  Verge  Purge and Splurge — in a thorough chart with commentaries and graphics.Buterin already indicated his intention to revive the original vision of the ""cypherpunk"" revolution for the Ethereum blockchain  as previously reported.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 08:00:00","Whales Buying Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) Dump","U.Today - A recent plummet in the value of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has caught the attention of whales who were looking for good entries. Notably  two whale wallets have seized this dip as an opportunity  making substantial purchases of WBTC and ETH at what many are considering ""the bottom.""The wallet designated as 0x8B20 took a bullish stance  deploying a total of $3 million USD in stablecoins to acquire 35.18 WBTC at $42 641 each and 674.18 ETH at $2 225 each.This strategic action by cryptocurrency whales is a significant indicator of strong market sentiment. Such movements often suggest a belief among experienced investors that any forthcoming dips in price will be short-lived  offering quick recovery and providing upward momentum. Following the whales' lead  the crypto market has recouped over 5% of its value  suggesting resilience and a possible trend reversal on the horizon.The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a critical factor that could catalyze a market turnaround. Despite the common ""sell the news"" events that often follow such announcements  the approval of a Bitcoin ETF would likely boost investor confidence  attracting institutional money.As the market navigates through these turbulent waters  the actions of whale investors offer a glimmer of optimism. The significant investments from these large-scale holders suggest a belief in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If the ETF receives the green light  we may well witness a significant rally  affirming the whales' bullish maneuvers and potentially leading to a market reversal that could reshape the investment landscape.This article was originally published on U.Today"

In 2021  20% of his followers were sure that this ""flippening"" would never happen.Ethereum (ETH) L2s accomplished historic milestoneIn the first days of 2024  the aggregated sum of value locked in Ethereum-based L2 protocols exceeded that of all non-Ethereum blockchains. While Ethereum L2s are responsible for $20.7 billion in equivalent  the rest of blockchains amassed $19.6 billion  as noticed by Stark today  Jan. 4  2024.Meanwhile  he stressed that the metrics cannot be treated as exactly similar: For second-layer networks  the indicator refers to the sum of assets on L2  including native tokens. For L1s  the metrics reflect the sum of assets locked in dApps on this or that blockchain.The analyst used L2Beat's data for tracking second-layer blockchains and DefiLlama to analyze what is happening on non-Ethereum L1s.It is interesting that back in September 2021  he asked his audience about the date of this ""L2-over-L1"" flippening. While the majority of his followers were sure that this fact could take place in 2022  20% answered that it would never happen.The L2s ecosystem was 20 times smaller than the L1s one  as of the date of the first voting.

"2024-01-18 08:00:00","XRP Saw Biggest Price Drop Since August: Here's What Happened","U.Today - XRP has recently experienced a seismic price drop  one we have not seen since August. A massive price wick  as shown on the chart  liquidated millions of dollars worth of derivatives in less than an hour. This unexpected plunge has effectively erased the steady accumulation phase that XRP had been undergoing  catching traders off guard and disrupting numerous trading portfolios.The chart analysis reveals that after a period of consolidation within a narrowing price range — a pattern that traders often interpret as accumulation — XRP broke down dramatically. The long downward wick signifies a sharp sell-off  pushing prices to plummet swiftly. Such price action is typically indicative of a market where sellers have overwhelmed buyers  leading to rapid liquidations as stop-loss orders are triggered en masse.XRP/USDT chart by TradingViewThis sudden downturn has cast a shadow over XRP's short-term recovery prospects. With the accumulation phase nullified  the market must now grapple with the new reality of its invalidated bullish setups. This suggests that confidence in the asset's immediate growth potential has been significantly dented  and it may take some time for investor sentiment to rebuild and for the market to stabilize.However  such drastic price movements often stir the market  leading to increased trading activity. The surge in volatility following such a drop could attract fresh funds and opportunistic traders looking to capitalize on the new lower price levels. Market participants might see this as a discount entry point  potentially injecting liquidity and driving some degree of price correction.Ethereum gains strength against BitcoinA substantial number of analysts believe that the ETH/BTC chart is a pivotal indicator for gauging market risk exposure. Historically  it reflects Ethereum's performance relative to the more established Bitcoin. Until recently  this metric had been in decline  with Ethereum trailing behind Bitcoin and signaling a more cautious market sentiment toward Ethereum's future prospects.However  the tides appear to be changing. The ETH/BTC pair has formed a ""higher low"" pattern. This pattern is significant as it often indicates a weakening of the previous downtrend  potentially preluding a reversal. The formation of a higher low suggests that Ethereum is gaining strength relative to Bitcoin  and could be a precursor to an upcoming rally.The chart provided demonstrates this potential turning point. Ethereum's price  while still exhibiting volatility  shows signs of stabilizing and possibly gearing up for an upward move. The convergence of the moving averages and the leveling off of the RSI suggest that the selling pressure is abating  and the momentum could be shifting in favor of bulls.If Ethereum can maintain this crucial higher low formation  it could entice risk-tolerant investors back into the market  bolstering the sentiment around the Ethereum ecosystem.Shiba Inu is off the leashShiba Inu has seen its most substantial price drop since 2022. This hasty decline in SHIB's value has stunned investors and raised questions about the meme token's resilience and future.The chart analysis of SHIB's recent price action shows a dramatic sell-off  with the asset breaking down below key support levels. The price wick  extending far below the consolidation zone  suggests a rapid and large-scale exit from the asset  resulting in millions worth of SHIB being sold in a short period. The sharp downturn not only startled the market but also effectively nullified the previous accumulation phase  throwing numerous trading setups into disarray.The magnitude of this price drop could be a signal of a broader funds migration  with investors possibly steering away from high-risk meme coins like SHIB in favor of more established and ""serious"" assets. This shift may be part of a larger derisking trend within the crypto market  as participants seek stability amid economic uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny.This article was originally published on U.Today"

A prominent figure in the crypto space known as Crypto Tony on X (formerly Twitter) recently shared insights  asserting that Ethereum's bullish momentum could be initiated if it maintains a position above $2 130  with even greater optimism should it reclaim the range high at $2 500.As of the latest market data  Ethereum is currently priced at $2 262  reflecting a modest 1.22% increase over the past 24 hours. However  the cryptocurrency has experienced a 4.29% decrease over the last 30 days  showcasing the volatility inherent in the market. The trading volume for ETH has notably surged by 75.24% in the last 24 hours  reaching $9 626 210 522  indicating heightened activity and interest in the digital asset.Crypto Tony's emphasis on the $2 130 and $2 500 thresholds aligns with the sentiment of many Ethereum enthusiasts  who closely monitor these levels as potential catalysts for a sustained bullish trend. The cryptocurrency community eagerly waits to see if Ethereum can not only maintain but surpass these critical levels in the coming days.Potential bullish catalystIn a related development  the Ethereum network is on the verge of a major upgrade  known as the Prague upgrade or Pectra upgrade.

"2024-01-18 08:00:00","Will This Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Pattern Start Reversal?","U.Today - Shiba Inu is currently showcasing a price pattern that could potentially lead to a reversal. The pattern  characterized by SHIB breaking below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average  might be indicating an opportune moment for investors and traders to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into their positions.The 200-day EMA is a critical long-term indicator that many investors watch to determine market trends. A break below this line can often suggest bearish sentiment. However  for the astute investor  this can also present an attractive entry point  especially for those looking to DCA or accumulating during dips in anticipation of future gains.Despite the current breach  SHIB's approach to this level has historically been met with a strong reaction from buyers  sometimes resulting in a notable price reversal. If the pattern holds true to its historical behavior  the price of SHIB may soon find sufficient support to halt the decline and initiate an upward trajectory.Nonetheless  it is crucial to acknowledge that SHIB has been facing consistent selling pressure  evident every time there is an attempt to push the price higher. This consistent sell-off following attempts to rise has created a challenging environment for SHIB to sustain any substantial gains. The current market scenario for SHIB is a delicate balancing act between bearish pressure and the potential for a bullish reversal. For new investors looking to enter the market  the area just below the 200 EMA could prove to be a significant level  provided they are comfortable with the inherent risks involved with such volatile assets. Older investors can use the price level to dollar cost average their holdings. Solana loses steamSolana (SOL)  the blockchain platform known for its speed and efficiency  has recently experienced a significant breakdown  signaling a pause in the bullish momentum that had characterized its market behavior. After a prolonged uptrend  the correction has aggravated into a more pronounced price fall  indicating a shift in market sentiment.The chart reveals that Solana has decisively exited its previous uptrend  characterized by higher highs and higher lows  and has entered a correction phase. The volume profile during this downturn suggests that the selling pressure has intensified  leading to a breakdown below critical support levels. This pattern is often a precursor to further declines as market confidence wanes.For those looking for a scenario in which Solana could rebound  a relief rally could emerge from oversold conditions  indicated by RSI approaching lower bounds. Such a rally would require a catalyst  possibly in the form of positive developments within the Solana ecosystem or broader crypto market sentiment shifts. A rebound scenario might also be supported by traders looking for value buys at lower price points  thus creating sufficient buying pressure to counter the recent downtrend.Ethereum meets substantial supportEthereum has recently encountered a significant level of support  touching the 50-day Exponential Moving Average  a critical indicator for determining local trends.The 50-day EMA has historically been a stronghold for Ethereum's price  acting as a pivot point between the bullish and bearish territories. After a period of decline  Ethereum's approach to this level suggests that we may be on the cusp of a reversal. This is particularly compelling given Ethereum's past performance  where touches of the 50 EMA have often led to a resurgence in buying activity  driving the price upward.Currently  the intersection with the 50 EMA aligns with a descending trading volume  indicating a potential decrease in selling pressure. This trend could signify market consolidation before a bullish reversal  as lower volume alongside support touchpoints often precedes a shift in momentum.The implications of this volume decrease are twofold. First  it may suggest that the recent sell-off is losing steam  and the market is running out of sellers at current price levels. Second  it may imply that the market is awaiting further catalysts or developments within the Ethereum ecosystem  such as updates on Ethereum 2.0 or broader crypto market trends  before initiating the next significant move.This article was originally published on U.Today"
"2024-01-18 08:00:00","Ethereum (ETH) at Critical Juncture as Michaël van de Poppe Predicts Bullish Breakout","U.Today - In the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market  Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a critical juncture  with renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicting a potential bullish breakout. In a recent tweet  van de Poppe conveyed his insights  indicating that Ethereum was approaching the low of 2022 and was likely to absorb liquidity at that level.He expressed the belief that in the event of a spot ETF approval for Bitcoin (BTC)  there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. Following this  analyst van de Poppe foresaw a rotation of funds into Ethereum  accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence.According to the most recent data  Ethereum is presently valued at $2 294  indicating a noteworthy 3.04% uptick in the past 24 hours. The trading volume within this period has experienced a substantial surge  escalating by 36.14% and peaking at $12.48 billion. In the aftermath of this modest rally  ETH has observed $21.60 million in short liquidations and $11.79 million in long liquidations  as reported by CoinGlass.Spillover effectThe focal point of van de Poppe's analysis revolves around the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The cryptocurrency market anticipates a breakthrough  with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)  a financial behemoth  leading the charge. BlackRock  along with other prominent firms such as Grayscale Investments  Valkyrie and ARK 21Shares  has recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs.Market sentiment is building as BlackRock expresses confidence in the SEC's approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF  with expectations pointing toward a potential decision as early as this Wednesday. A positive outcome could trigger a ripple effect in the broader cryptocurrency market  impacting not only Bitcoin but also potentially leading to a rotation of funds into Ethereum.Michaël Van de Poppe's prediction hinges on the notion that Bitcoin spot ETF approval may prompt a notable uptrend for Ethereum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments  recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential spillover effects of major regulatory decisions.

This upcoming update is called the Prague upgrade  also referred to as the Pectra upgrade  and has been a hot topic in the Ethereum community.Testnets are essential staging grounds for new features  and the Dencun upgrade will first roll out across several testnets: Goerli on Jan. 17  Sepolia on Jan. 30 and Holesky on Feb. 7  2024. These testnets will allow developers to fine-tune the upgrade in a controlled environment  ensuring everything operates smoothly before going live on the main network.Source: Tim Beiko on Ethereum MagiciansThe core development team is currently in a debate over prioritizing the implementation of Verkle trees  a data structure that would optimize storage and access to information on Ethereum. While some developers advocate making Verkle trees the sole focus  others suggest pursuing a smaller feature fork alongside the Verkle development.The main argument for concentrating solely on Verkle trees stems from their complexity and the time investment needed to implement them effectively. This could mean that if Verkle trees become the next priority  no new execution layer (EL) features might appear for 12 to 24 months  or possibly longer.Nevertheless  there is an understanding that even if the focus shifts to Verkle trees  minor updates to the Ethereum Layer (EL) might still be necessary. For example  changes to the gas limit for data availability are crucial for Ethereum's scaling solutions and require coordination across both the execution layer and the consensus layer (CL).The Prague upgrade is set to include various proposals that aim to refine the Ethereum platform on different layers  including precompiles for specific cryptographic operations  a new EVM object format (EOF) and modifications to smart contract capabilities.The Prague upgrade promises to be a significant event that will shape the future of the Ethereum ecosystem.

"2024-01-18 08:00:00","Ethereum (ETH) Layer 2 Networks Growth Is Crucial: Here's Why","U.Today - With Ethereum transaction activities increasingly shifting to Layer 2 (L2) networks  the ecosystem is bracing for a potential new bull run  one that could be predominantly led by these L2 platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism. The surge in L2 transactions  which have grown by an astounding 90 times since 2021  paints a clear picture: The next wave of decentralized finance (DeFi)  non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and meme coins is likely to be rooted in these scalable networks.The main network layer of Ethereum has faced significant challenges in scaling to meet the demands of its growing user base and application field. High gas fees and network congestion have highlighted the limitations of the current infrastructure  making the need for efficient L2 solutions more pressing than ever. These L2 networks are designed to offload the burden from the Ethereum mainnet  offering faster transactions and lower fees  making them an attractive alternative for developers.ETH/USD chart by TradingViewThis shift toward L2 networks does not just represent a stop-gap solution but is becoming integral to Ethereum's future. It is reasonable to expect that the initial signs of a rally within the Ethereum ecosystem will emerge on these scalable platforms. They are set to be the breeding ground for innovation and the go-to space for new projects in DeFi  NFTs and beyond.The new Ethereum road map  as outlined by Vitalik Buterin  underscores this transition. Key updates to the road map include the solidification of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge proof of stake (PoS) improvements  which aims to enhance the efficiency and security of the network. Buterin has also highlighted the importance of cross-rollup standards and interoperability as areas requiring long-term development. These would enable seamless communication and transaction execution across different L2 solutions  furthering the composability of the ecosystem.Further developments such as the redesign of The Scourge  the nearing readiness of Verkle trees for inclusion  and the shrinking of ""state expiry"" to reflect a broader consensus show a commitment to continuous improvement. Additions like deep cryptography  including obfuscation and delay-encrypted mempools  suggest a forward-looking approach to security and privacy within the network.This article was originally published on U.Today"
